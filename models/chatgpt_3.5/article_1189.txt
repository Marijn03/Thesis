In the world of computer science, there's a cool method called Knowledge Distillation (KD) that helps smaller machine learning models learn from bigger ones. Think of it like a smart teacher passing on their wisdom to a student. But here's the twist: the way they learn can be improved! Scientists realized that by giving the teacher and student different examples to learn from, the student can understand better. It's like customizing lessons for each student in class. By using this new approach, the student can learn even more efficiently, especially when the teacher is super smart but the student needs simpler lessons. This discovery could lead to smarter, more efficient computer programs in the future. So, in a nutshell, KD helps make computers smarter by giving them better lessons tailored just for them.
