Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) is a cutting-edge method in computer science for understanding and analyzing complex networks like social media connections or biological pathways. By learning from patterns in small parts of the network and combining them to understand the whole structure, DGI helps computers make sense of big data, even sometimes performing better than when they're explicitly taught!
