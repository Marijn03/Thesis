Recent advancements in computer science have led to exciting progress in understanding how computers interpret language. Scientists have developed methods like ELMo to help computers understand words in context, like humans do. They found that training computers to predict the next word in a sentence (language modeling) works really well for teaching them about language. However, they also discovered that simply freezing the trained model may not be the best approach for all tasks. Some tasks benefit from different types of training, and there's still a lot to learn about how computers can use outside knowledge to understand language better. This research opens up new possibilities for how computers can learn and interact with human language, paving the way for even more exciting developments in the future.
