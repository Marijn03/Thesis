In this paper, researchers propose a new method called Diversely Stale Parameters (DSP) to improve training of neural networks, solving problems like forward, backward, and update locking, especially in large networks spread across multiple devices. They found that DSP speeds up training, making it more robust and accurate compared to existing methods, which could be really helpful for making computers smarter in the future!
