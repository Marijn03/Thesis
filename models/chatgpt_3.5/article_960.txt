In the exciting world of computer science, researchers are tackling a big challenge: how to teach computers to make smart decisions over long periods in tricky environments where rewards are scarce. They've come up with something called Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to help, but there are still some problems to solve. That's where a new idea called Hierarchical Decompositional Reinforcement Learning (HiDe) comes in. HiDe breaks tasks into smaller, easier pieces but still trains everything together. By combining different levels of thinking, like planning and control, it helps computers figure out tough navigation tasks in maze-like settings. What's cool is that this system can learn to solve new problems it hasn't seen before and even teach other computers how to do it. They tested it out in maze environments, and it worked like a charm, even transferring its skills to more complex agents like ants or humanoids. This could be a big step forward in teaching computers to think and act more like us, opening up a world of possibilities in robotics, gaming, and beyond.
