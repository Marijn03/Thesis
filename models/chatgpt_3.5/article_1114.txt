Scientists have discovered fascinating similarities between the olfactory systems of flies and mice, despite these species evolving separately for millions of years. They've used artificial neural networks, computer models inspired by the brain, to understand why these similarities exist. By training these networks to sense odors, researchers found that both flies and mice use similar structures in their olfactory systems, like glomeruli and sparse random connections between neurons. These findings suggest that nature has optimized these structures for efficient odor sensing. Understanding these principles not only sheds light on how animals smell the world around them but also teaches us valuable lessons about designing efficient systems, which could inspire new technologies in the future.
