Capsule Networks are a type of artificial neural network designed to better model the spatial relationships and viewpoint-invariant properties of objects in images. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lose this spatial information through pooling operations. This paper introduces Siamese Capsule Networks, which adapt Capsule Networks for tasks like face verification where you need to determine if two face images are of the same person. Siamese networks take pairs of images as input. The Capsule Network encodes properties like pose and orientation into vector outputs called capsules. A contrastive loss function is used to train the network to maximize the difference between capsules for different identities while minimizing it for the same identity. The researchers evaluated Siamese Capsule Networks on face verification datasets like AT&T and Labeled Faces in the Wild. They found this approach works particularly well in the few-shot learning setting, where the testset contains identities not seen during training. Capsule Networks show promise for learning complex visual concepts from limited data, an important problem in computer vision.
