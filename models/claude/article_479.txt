Reinforcement learning (RL) is a technique used to train artificial intelligence agents to perform tasks by rewarding desired behaviors. However, RL agents often overfit to the training environments, making them unable to generalize to new situations. This limits their usefulness in real-world applications where conditions can change. Researchers studied this overfitting problem in visual navigation tasks and found that even when trained on multiple environments, RL agents still struggled to generalize. 

To address this issue, they proposed a new method called "Invariance Regularization" which combines RL with supervised learning. Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, which can improve generalization. The Invariance Regularization method encourages the RL agent's policy (decision-making strategy) to be invariant to changes in the observations that should not affect its actions.

Experiments were conducted using the VizDoom platform, which simulates different environments. The results showed that Invariance Regularization improved the generalization of RL policies to environments not seen during training, with stable performance across different trials. This research demonstrates how combining techniques like RL and supervised learning can enhance the robustness and applicability of artificial intelligence systems.
