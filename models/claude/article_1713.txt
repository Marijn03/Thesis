Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain that are capable of learning patterns from data. Traditionally, neural networks use real numbers for calculations, but researchers are exploring the use of complex numbers instead. This study compared the performance of complex-valued neural networks with real-valued ones on various tasks like image classification and question answering. It found that for simple tasks, complex networks performed similarly or slightly worse than real networks, but for specialized architectures, complex networks outperformed real ones. Complex networks may be better suited when the input data has an inherent complex nature or when the network architecture can leverage the mathematical properties of complex numbers.
