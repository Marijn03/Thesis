Scientists studied the olfactory (smell) systems of flies and mice, which evolved over 600 million years apart but share many similarities. They trained artificial neural networks (computer models inspired by the brain) to recognize odors. Interestingly, these networks developed structures resembling those in real olfactory systems, like clusters of neurons (glomeruli) and sparse, random connections between layers. The emergence of glomeruli was not due to noise but required an "expansion layer" of more neurons downstream. Having this expansion layer with about 7 times more connections made the network robust to variations in individual connection strengths. This work explains why olfactory circuits evolved similarly across species - the structures are optimal for odor sensing and provide robustness. Studying how neural networks solve problems can give insights into how the brain's neural circuits are designed.
