Deep Graph Infomax is a new way to learn good representations (numerical descriptions) of nodes in graph data like social networks or molecule structures, without using any labeled data. By maximizing how much the node representations capture about the overall graph structure, DGI can achieve similar or better performance than traditional supervised learning approaches on node classification tasks like identifying which nodes belong to certain categories.
