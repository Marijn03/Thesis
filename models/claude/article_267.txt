Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial intelligence model widely used for tasks like image recognition. Traditionally, CNNs are trained on fixed image sizes, but struggle when tested on different sizes. This article introduces a new "MixSize" training approach where the CNN is exposed to a mix of different image sizes during training. Models trained this way perform better across different image resolutions at test time. For example, a CNN called ResNet50 achieved 76.43% accuracy on 160x160 pixel images after MixSize training, matching larger models' accuracy but using 2x less computation. MixSize also allows trading off training time versus higher accuracy by adjusting average image size during training. Overall, this method makes CNNs more robust to variations in input data, an important property for real-world applications.
