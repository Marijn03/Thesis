Recent advancements in computer vision have led to the development of Siamese Capsule Networks, a powerful tool for learning complex relationships between entities in images. This technology extends the capabilities of traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by preserving important internal properties such as location, orientation, and pose. The key innovation lies in their ability to perform dynamic routing, sending lower-level capsule outputs as input to parent capsules, achieving translation equivariance. This approach addresses the limitations of crude routing operations like max and average pooling, which often result in a significant loss of information. Siamese Capsule Networks have shown promising results in face verification tasks, especially when there are limited instances per class and in few-shot learning settings with unseen subjects during testing. The network is trained using a contrastive loss function, maximizing the differences between classes while minimizing variations within the same class. This method enhances the model's ability to learn from limited data and converges faster. The paper introduces a novel architecture, the Siamese Capsule Network, which adapts Capsule Networks for pairwise learning, demonstrating successful performance on two face verification datasets.
