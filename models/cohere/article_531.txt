Neural networks, powerful tools used for classification tasks, sometimes struggle with inputs that are only slightly different from their training data. This issue, known as adversarial examples, indicates that the network's decision boundaries are too close to the training data. In a recent study, researchers focused on binary classification and found that even linear classifiers can suffer from this problem when trained with the commonly used cross-entropy loss function. They introduced a new training method called differential training, which defines a loss function on pairs of points from different classes, pushing the decision boundary further away from the training data and improving the network's robustness. Interestingly, they also found that the dimensionality of the training data plays a role, with low-dimensional data being more susceptible to small margins between decision boundaries and data points. The findings suggest that the choice of loss function and training algorithm are critical factors in the network's performance and robustness, providing valuable insights for improving the resilience of neural networks against adversarial examples. This research opens up new directions for enhancing the reliability of AI systems, especially in security-critical applications.
