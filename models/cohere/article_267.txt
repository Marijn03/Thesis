Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful tools used in various fields, but they have limitations when it comes to image size. A new training method, "MixSize," has been developed to address this issue by training CNNs with varying image and batch sizes. This technique reduces the network's sensitivity to image size, improving performance and flexibility. The result is faster and more efficient inference, especially on smaller images, without sacrificing accuracy. The trade-off lies between training time and final accuracy, where smaller image sizes speed up training but may impact peak accuracy. This method also provides the option between faster training and higher accuracy for specific test image sizes. This development enhances the practicality and adaptability of CNNs, making them more accessible and effective for a wider range of applications.
