Complex-valued neural networks, which use complex numbers for calculations, have often been overlooked due to training challenges and the success of real-number-based alternatives. However, new research highlights their potential, especially when the input data has a natural complex interpretation, like in signal processing. When compared to real-valued networks, complex-valued networks can offer superior performance, but this depends on the architecture and the specific activation functions used. The choice of activation function and the number of parameters are critical to the performance of complex-valued multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on classification tasks. This emerging field is seeing complex-valued neural networks applied to a growing range of tasks, with their unique advantages being increasingly recognized.
