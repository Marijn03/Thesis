The field of face recognition has seen exciting developments with the introduction of margin-based loss functions, which enhance the discriminability of features by increasing the margin between different classes. A novel approach, CurricularFace, is proposed as a training strategy that adapts to the importance of easy and hard samples during different stages of training. This adaptive curriculum learning loss function automatically emphasizes easy samples in the early stages and hard samples later, resulting in improved performance. By incorporating ideas from curriculum learning, CurricularFace dynamically adjusts the weights of hard samples, leading to a flexible decision boundary. Compared to popular loss functions like ArcFace and SV-Arc-Softmax, CurricularFace offers a more nuanced approach to sample weighting. Additionally, it provides a clearer definition of hard samples than Focal Loss, which only focuses on relatively hard samples. The effectiveness of CurricularFace has been demonstrated through experiments on facial benchmarks, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives. This innovative loss function also reduces the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning and improves convergence. The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in face recognition is attributed to large training datasets and well-designed network architectures, alongside these advanced loss functions. With ongoing research in this area, further improvements and applications in face recognition technology can be expected. This adaptive curriculum learning approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the performance and efficiency of face recognition systems.
