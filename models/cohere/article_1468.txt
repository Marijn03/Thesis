Spectral clustering is a powerful technique for analyzing unlabeled data, and SpectralNet is a new deep learning approach that improves upon it. By embedding data points into a specific mathematical space, SpectralNet can efficiently cluster similar data points together. The use of deep learning makes SpectralNet scalable to large datasets and provides a simple way to handle new, unseen data. A key contribution is the use of Siamese networks, which learn to measure similarities between data points, improving the clustering quality. Additionally, applying SpectralNet to data transformed by autoencoders further enhances its performance. The end-to-end learning process requires no human labeling and is entirely unsupervised. Theoretical analysis provides insights into the size and capabilities of the SpectralNet model. The method has been successfully tested on benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results, especially for complex, non-convex clusters. By integrating spectral clustering with deep learning, SpectralNet offers a valuable tool for unsupervised learning tasks, providing an effective way to discover hidden structures in data. This advancement showcases the potential of combining classical algorithms with modern deep learning techniques to address long-standing challenges in computer science.
