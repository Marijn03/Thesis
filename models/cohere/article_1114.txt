The article compares the olfactory systems of flies and mice, which have similar anatomical and functional structures despite their evolutionary distance. To understand this convergence, artificial neural networks were trained to classify odors. Interestingly, these networks developed structures similar to those in the olfactory system, including glomeruli and sparse, random connections. The study found that an expansion layer is key to the formation of glomeruli, and it enhances the system's robustness. These findings offer insights into why certain features are optimal for odor sensing, and they provide a framework to understand the evolutionary design of olfactory circuits. This research integrates computer science and biology, showcasing how artificial neural networks can help unravel the mysteries of nature and providing valuable knowledge for high school students interested in these fields. Overall, the study deepens our understanding of the intricate design of the olfactory system and its ability to process odors efficiently.
