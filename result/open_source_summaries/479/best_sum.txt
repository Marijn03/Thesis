The document discusses the issue of overfitting in artificial intelligence (AI) agents, specifically in visual navigation tasks. Overfitting occurs when an AI agent becomes too specialized to a specific environment and struggles to adapt to changes or new environments. The authors investigate this problem using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which are commonly used to train AI agents to perform tasks. They find that even when trained on multiple environments, RL agents can still overfit to the training environments. To address this issue, the authors propose a new method called invariance regularization, which combines RL with supervised learning to encourage the AI agent to be more robust to changes in the environment. The results show that this method improves the generalization of the AI agent to new environments. The authors also discuss the importance of generalization in AI, as it allows agents to adapt to new situations and environments, making them more useful in real-world applications.
