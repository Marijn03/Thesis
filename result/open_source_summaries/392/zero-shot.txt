Unsupervised embedding learning is a technique that aims to extract good representations from data without the use of human-annotated labels. This approach is gaining popularity due to the challenges in collecting massive-scale labels required for supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach called Super-AND, which is based on the Anchor Neighbourhood Discovery model. Super-AND makes similar samples gather even within a low-density space and keeps features invariant against augmentation. Our model outperforms existing approaches in various benchmark datasets, achieving an accuracy of 89.2% in the CIFAR-10 dataset with the Resnet18 backbone network, a 2.9% gain over the state-of-the-art. The development of unsupervised embedding learning techniques has been led by supervised learning, which requires thousands or more labeled data. However, high annotation costs have become a significant drawback in training a scalable and practical model in many domains. In contrast, unsupervised deep learning that requires no label has recently started to gain attention in computer vision tasks. The proposed Super-AND model combines the advantages of sample specificity and clustering strategy to mitigate the noisy supervision via neighborhood analysis. The newly proposed UE-loss that groups nearby data points even in a low-density space while maintaining invariant features via data augmentation is a key component of Super-AND. The experiments with both coarse-grained and fine-grained datasets demonstrate our model's outstanding performance against the state-of-the-art models.
