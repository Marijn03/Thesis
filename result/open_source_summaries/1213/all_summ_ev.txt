The backpropagation algorithm is a popular way to train neural networks, but it has some limitations. For example, when a neural network is very large and spread across multiple devices, it can get stuck in a "locking" problem, which slows down the training process. The authors of this paper propose a new algorithm called Diversely Stale Parameters (DSP) that can handle these issues without losing accuracy or using too much memory. They also prove that DSP is guaranteed to work for non-convex problems and show that it can train deep neural networks faster and more robustly than other methods.

Note: The important entities in this document are the backpropagation algorithm, the neural network, and the proposed algorithm Diversely Stale Parameters (DSP). The important dates are not mentioned, as this is a theoretical paper without specific dates. The events happening in this document are the limitations of the backpropagation algorithm and the proposal of a new algorithm to address these limitations. The result of these events is the development of a new algorithm that can train neural networks more efficiently and robustly.
