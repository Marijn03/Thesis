The backpropagation algorithm is a widely used method for training artificial neural networks, but it has some limitations. For example, when a network is very large and spread across multiple devices, it can get stuck in certain problems, which can slow down the training process. Researchers have proposed different solutions to address these issues, but they often come with trade-offs such as reduced accuracy or increased memory usage. A new approach called Diversely Stale Parameters (DSP) has been developed to overcome these challenges, and it has been tested on deep convolutional neural networks, showing significant improvements in training speed and robustness.
