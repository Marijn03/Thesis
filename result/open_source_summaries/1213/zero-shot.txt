The backpropagation algorithm, a popular method for training neural networks, has some major limitations. When dealing with very large neural networks spread across multiple devices, it can get stuck in problems like "forward locking," "backward locking," and "update locking," which slow down the training process. The authors of this paper propose a new solution called Diversely Stale Parameters (DSP) that can tackle all these challenges without sacrificing accuracy or using too much memory. They also prove that their method is guaranteed to work for non-convex problems and show through experiments that it can speed up the training process while improving the robustness and generalization of the neural network.

(Note: The important entities are neural networks, devices, and algorithms. The important dates are not mentioned in this document as it is a theoretical paper. The events happening in this document are the challenges faced by the backpropagation algorithm and the proposal of a new solution called Diversely Stale Parameters. The result of these events is a new efficient training algorithm that can address the challenges without loss of accuracy or memory issue.)
