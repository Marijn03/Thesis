In machine learning, a problem called "negative transfer" occurs when a model is trained on multiple tasks and becomes biased towards one task over others. This can lead to poor performance on tasks that are not well-represented in the training data. The authors of this paper explore this problem in a scenario where a model is trained to classify animals based on their appearance, but the training data also contains images of the animals' habitats. The model may become biased towards the habitat features instead of the animal's appearance, which can lead to poor performance on rare or unseen instances.

The authors propose an adversarial training approach to mitigate the effects of negative transfer by viewing the problem as a domain adaptation problem. This approach involves training the model to ignore the unrelated features in the training data and focus on the relevant features. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two datasets and show that it can improve the model's performance on rare or unseen instances.

The authors also discuss the limitations of previous approaches to negative transfer, which rely on regularization techniques, and argue that their approach is more effective and applicable to a wider range of models, including neural networks. Overall, the paper presents a solution to a common problem in machine learning and demonstrates the importance of considering the relationships between different tasks and features in the training data.
