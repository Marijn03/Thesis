Deep neural networks (DNNs) are great at solving many problems, but they can also be prone to overfitting, which means they perform well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. To combat this, researchers have developed a technique called dropout, which randomly sets some of the neurons in the network to zero during training. This helps the network generalize better to new data. However, there are some limitations to dropout. For example, the dropout rate (the proportion of neurons that are set to zero) needs to be carefully tuned, and it can be incompatible with another important technique called batch normalization. The researchers in this paper propose a new version of dropout called "Jumpout" that addresses these limitations. Jumpout uses a different way of setting the dropout rate and rescaling the output of the network, which helps the network generalize even better and perform well on a variety of tasks. Overall, Jumpout is a simple but effective way to improve the performance of DNNs and help them generalize better to new data.

The important entities in this document are deep neural networks, dropout, and batch normalization. The important dates are not explicitly mentioned, but the paper is likely referring to the development of deep learning and the introduction of dropout and batch normalization as techniques in the field. The events in this document are the development of dropout and batch normalization, the limitations of these techniques, and the proposal of a new version of dropout called Jumpout. The result of these events is a more effective and generalizable deep learning technique.
