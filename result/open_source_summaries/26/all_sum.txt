The document discusses a technique called dropout, which is used to improve the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) by preventing overfitting. The authors of the paper identify three key issues with dropout: it can lead to inconsistent normalization between training and testing conditions, it doesn't adapt to different layers and samples, and it can be incompatible with batch normalization. To address these issues, the authors propose a new method called Jumpout, which samples the dropout rate using a decreasing distribution to encourage the model to learn from nearby data points. Jumpout also adaptively normalizes the dropout rate and rescales the outputs to maintain consistency between training and testing. The results show that Jumpout performs significantly better than the original dropout method on various datasets, while introducing minimal additional memory and computation costs.

The important entities in this document are deep neural networks, dropout, and batch normalization. The important dates mentioned are not applicable, as this is a scholarly paper discussing ongoing research. The events happening in this document are the authors' observations about the limitations of dropout and their proposal of the Jumpout method. The result of these events is the development of a new and improved method for improving the performance of deep neural networks.
