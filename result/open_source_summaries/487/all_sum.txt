The document discusses the importance of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in machine learning models. OOD samples are data points that are different from the training data and can cause the model to make incorrect predictions. The authors propose a new type of classifier called a generative classifier that can detect OOD samples more accurately than existing methods. The generative classifier works by learning the class-conditional distributions of the data, which are the probability distributions of each class. The authors show that this approach can be used to detect OOD samples in both image and tabular data. The key dates mentioned in the document are the dates of previous research papers that have addressed the issue of OOD detection. The important events in the document are the development of the generative classifier and its application to OOD detection. The result of these events is a more accurate method for detecting OOD samples, which can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models in real-world applications.
