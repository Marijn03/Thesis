The study compares the olfactory systems of flies and mice, which are separated by 600 million years of evolution. Despite this vast difference, their olfactory systems share many similarities in terms of their anatomy and function. The researchers wanted to understand why these similarities exist and whether they are optimal for odor sensing. To do this, they used artificial neural networks to study how they could be designed to sense odors. They found that these networks quantitatively recapitulated the structures found in the olfactory systems of flies and mice, including the formation of glomeruli and sparse and random connectivity. The study suggests that these features may be optimal for odor sensing, and provides a framework for understanding the evolutionary convergence of olfactory circuits.

The important entities in this document are the olfactory systems of flies and mice, as well as the artificial neural networks used to study them. The important dates mentioned are the last two decades, during which the anatomy and function of the olfactory systems of flies and mice have been mapped in detail.

The events described in the document include the evolution of the olfactory systems of flies and mice, the development of artificial neural networks to study odor sensing, and the comparison of the structures and functions of the olfactory systems of flies and mice with those of the artificial neural networks. The result of these events is a deeper understanding of the evolutionary convergence of olfactory circuits and the optimal design of odor sensing systems.
