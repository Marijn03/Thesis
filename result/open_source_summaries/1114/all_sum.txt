The study explores the similarities between the olfactory systems of flies and mice, despite being separated by 600 million years of evolution. The researchers used artificial neural networks to understand the optimality of the design of these systems. They found that the networks quantitatively recapitulated the structures of the olfactory system, including the formation of glomeruli and sparse and random connectivity. The study suggests that these features are optimal for odor sensing and that the evolution of similar systems in different species is not a coincidence. The researchers also found that the formation of glomeruli and the sparse and random connectivity in the networks emerged naturally during the training process, without the need for specific input noise. This study provides a framework to explain the evolutionary convergence of olfactory circuits and offers insights into the anatomic and functional structure of the olfactory system.

The important entities in this document are the flies, mice, and artificial neural networks. The important dates mentioned are the last two decades, during which the anatomic and functional organization of the fly and mouse olfactory systems have been mapped to excruciating detail. The events happening in this document are the training of artificial neural networks to classify odors and the analysis of the anatomical and functional structures that emerge after training. The result of these events is the understanding of the optimality of the design of the olfactory systems and the explanation of the evolutionary convergence of olfactory circuits.
