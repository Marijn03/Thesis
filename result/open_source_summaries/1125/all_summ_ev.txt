The document discusses the importance of designing effective loss functions for face recognition systems. The authors propose a new loss function called CurricularFace, which adapts the importance of easy and hard samples during different training stages. This approach is inspired by the way humans learn, where easy tasks are learned first and then harder tasks are tackled. The authors use a novel modulation coefficient function to adjust the weights of hard samples in each mini-batch, making it more effective than previous methods.

The authors compare their approach to two existing methods, ArcFace and SV-Arc-Softmax, and show that their method outperforms them on popular facial benchmarks. They also discuss the limitations of these existing methods, such as not explicitly emphasizing the importance of hard samples and not adapting to the difficulty of samples during training.

The authors also mention that their method is easy to implement and robust to converge, making it a practical solution for face recognition systems. The document concludes by suggesting future research directions, such as designing better functions for negative cosine similarity and investigating the effects of noise samples.
