Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful tools used in many applications, such as image recognition, object detection, and more. However, these networks are typically trained on images of a specific size, which can limit their ability to work well with images of different sizes. Researchers have tried to address this issue by using techniques such as data augmentation, which involves artificially enlarging the dataset by applying transformations to the images. In this study, the researchers propose a new approach called "MixSize" that trains the network on multiple image sizes at the same time. They show that this approach improves the network's performance on a wide range of image sizes and allows for faster inference (i.e., processing time) at test time. Additionally, they demonstrate that this approach can be used to trade off between training time and final accuracy. The results show that the MixSize regime can achieve high accuracy with reduced computations, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
