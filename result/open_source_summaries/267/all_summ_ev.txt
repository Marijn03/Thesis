Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used to analyze images, but they are sensitive to the size of the images they are given. This means that if an image is smaller or larger than the size it was trained on, the CNN might not work as well. Researchers have tried to make CNNs more robust to different image sizes by using techniques like artificially enlarging the training dataset or modifying the network structure. However, these methods have limitations. A new method called "MixSize" has been developed, which trains CNNs on multiple image sizes at the same time. This makes the models more resilient to changes in image size and allows them to generalize well even on small images. The MixSize method also enables faster inference, as the models can be evaluated at smaller image sizes, which reduces the number of computations required. Additionally, the method can be used to trade off between training time and accuracy. Overall, the MixSize method is an improvement over previous methods and has the potential to be used in various applications, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
