Reinforcement learning (RL) is a way for computers to learn how to make decisions by trial and error. One challenge in RL is solving long-horizon tasks, which are tasks that require planning and decision-making over a long period of time. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a type of RL that tries to solve this problem by breaking down a complex task into smaller, simpler subtasks.

The authors of this paper propose a new HRL architecture called Hierarchical Decompositional Reinforcement Learning (HiDe). HiDe is designed to solve complex navigation tasks, such as finding a path through a maze. The architecture consists of three layers: a planning layer, a subgoal refinement layer, and a low-level control layer. Each layer has a specific role in solving the task.

The planning layer learns to plan a path to the goal, while the subgoal refinement layer refines the plan into smaller, more specific goals. The low-level control layer then controls the agent to achieve these goals. The authors show that their HiDe architecture can generalize to new environments and transfer between different agents.

In other words, the HiDe architecture can learn to solve a task in one environment and then apply that knowledge to solve the same task in a different environment. This is important because it allows the agent to adapt to new situations and learn from its experiences.

The authors also show that the planning layer can be transferred between different agents, which means that a planner learned by one agent can be used by another agent. This is useful because it allows agents to share knowledge and learn from each other.

Overall, the HiDe architecture is a promising approach to solving complex navigation tasks and has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as robotics and video games.
