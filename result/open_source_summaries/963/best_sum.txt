The document introduces Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), a novel approach for learning node representations in graph-structured data without labeled supervision. The important entities in this document are the node representations, patch representations, and graph convolutional network architectures. The important dates are not mentioned, as this is a theoretical paper. The events happening in this document are the development and demonstration of the DGI approach, which relies on maximizing mutual information between patch representations and high-level summaries of graphs. The result of these events is the creation of a new approach that can learn node embeddings that are mindful of the global structural properties of the graph, achieving competitive performance across various classification tasks, including node classification benchmarks and transductive and inductive learning setups.
