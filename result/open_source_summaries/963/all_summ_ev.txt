The document presents a new approach called Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) that helps computers learn representations of nodes in graph-structured data without needing labeled data. By analyzing the relationships between local patches of nodes and the overall structure of the graph, DGI creates node embeddings that are effective for various classification tasks, often performing as well as or even better than supervised learning methods.

Note: The important entities in this document are nodes, graphs, and patch representations. The important dates are not mentioned as this is a theoretical paper and does not have specific dates. The events happening in this document are the development and testing of the DGI approach. The result of these events is the creation of a new method for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data that achieves competitive performance on various classification tasks.
