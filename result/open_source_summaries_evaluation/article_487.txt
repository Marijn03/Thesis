In the all_sum article the summary contains a list of answers to the questions in the prompt. Normally, this is after the summary, now its stated twice in the summary. 

- Language: low level of complex terms (1:all_sum_ev , 1:all_sum , 3: zero-shot , 4:best_sum)
best_sum: “modeling the class-conditional distributions”, “separate Gaussian distributions” 
all_sum: easy language, explains every complex term
zero-shot: “decision boundary between classes”
all_sum_ev: easy language, explains every complex term

- Clarity and coherence: clear structure or explanation of the concepts in the paper (1:all_sum_ev, 2: best_sum, 3: zero-shot, 4: all_sum)
best_sum: clear structure, long sentence to explain classifier 
all_sum: it is listing the answers to questions in the summary
zero-shot: first sentence is long and confusing 
all_sum_ev: clear structure 

- Detail: provide sufficient detail on the experimental results and significance of the findings (1: best_sum, 2: zero-shot, 4: all_sum, 4: all_sum_ev)
all_sum and all_sum_ev included the same information
zero-shot: explains calculation of confidence scores
best_sum: explains Out-of-distribution (OOD), generative classifier aims to explicitly model class-conditional distributions as separable Gaussian distributions

- Confusing language: vague language like “They fixed a thing called loss scaling” (1: best_sum, 2: all_sum, 2: zero-shot, 4: all_sum_ev)
best_sum: These (1), they (0)
all_sum: These (2), they (0)
zero-shot: These (1), they (1)
all_sum_ev: These (0), they (2), “measuring how far they are from the normal patterns”
