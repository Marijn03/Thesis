- Language: low level of complex terms (1: best_sum, 1: all_sum, 1: zero-shot, 4: all_sum_ev)
best_sum: contains easy understandable language
all_sum: contains easy understandable language
zero-shot: contains easy understandable language
all_sum_ev: “domain adaptation perspective”, “to identify and leverage additional negative labels”

- Clarity and coherence: clear structure or explanation of the concepts in the paper (1: all_sum_ev, 2: zero-shot, 4: all_sum , 4: best_sum)
best_sum: the function of the third paragraph in the summary is not clear
all_sum: gives example to explain problem, but give limitations of other models after discussing the performance of their method
zero-shot: clear coherent story, could use paragraphs to define more structure to the summary. 
all_sum_ev: clear structure with paragraphs

- Detail: provide sufficient detail on the experimental results and significance of the findings (1: all_sum, 2: zero-shot, 3:best_sum , 4:all_sum_ev)
best_sum: doesn’t discuss the limitations of previous papers, doesn’t include the way the method is tested
all_sum: does not mention the importance of domain expertise
zero-shot: doesn’t discuss the limitations of previous papers, does not mention the importance of domain expertise
all_sum_ev: doesn’t discuss the limitations of previous papers, doesn’t include the way the method is tested

- Confusing language: vague language like “They fixed a thing called loss scaling” (1: all_sum, 2: best_sum, 4: zero-shot, 4: all_sum_ev)
best_sum: These (1), they (1)
