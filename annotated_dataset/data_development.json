        "article": "Weight-sharing\u2014the simultaneous optimization of multiple neural networks using the same parameters\u2014has emerged as a key component of state-of-the-art neural architecture search. However, its success is poorly understood and often found to be surprising. We argue that, rather than just being an optimization trick, the weight-sharing approach is induced by the relaxation of a structured hypothesis space, and introduces new algorithmic and theoretical challenges as well as applications beyond neural architecture search. Algorithmically, we show how the geometry of ERM for weight-sharing requires greater care when designing gradient- based minimization methods and apply tools from non-convex non-Euclidean optimization to give general-purpose algorithms that adapt to the underlying structure. We further analyze the learning-theoretic behavior of the bilevel optimization solved by practical weight-sharing methods. Next, using kernel configuration and NLP feature selection as case studies, we demonstrate how weight-sharing applies to the architecture search generalization of NAS and effectively optimizes the resulting bilevel objective. Finally, we use our optimization analysis to develop a simple exponentiated gradient method for NAS that aligns with the underlying optimization geometry and matches state-of-the-art approaches on CIFAR-10. Weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS) methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance while requiring computation training of just a single shared-weights network (Pham et al., 2018; Li and Talwalkar, 2019; . However, weight-sharing remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel perspective on weight-sharing NAS motivated by the key observation that these methods subsume the architecture hyperparameters as another set of learned parameters of the shared-weights network, in effect extending the hypothesis class. An important ramification of this insight is that weight-sharing is not NAS-specific and can be used to tune hyperparameters corresponding to parameterized feature maps of the input data. We refer this larger subset of hyperparameter optimization problems as architecture search, and we study the following two questions associated with weight-sharing applied to the architecture search problem: 1. How can we efficiently optimize the objective induced by applying weight sharing to architecture search, namely minimizing empirical risk in the joint space of model and architecture parameters? For large structured search spaces that preclude brute force search, a natural approach to architecture search with weight-sharing is to use gradient-based methods to minimize the empirical risk over a continuous relaxation of the discrete space . Although this has allowed NAS researchers to apply their preferred optimizers to determine architecture weights, it is far from clear that the success of established methods for unconstrained optimization in training neural networks will naturally extend to these constrained and often non-Euclidean environments. As we foresee that architecture search spaces will continue to become more complex and multi-faceted, we argue for and develop a more principled, geometry-aware formulation of the optimization problem. Drawing upon the mirror descent meta-algorithm (Beck and Teboulle, 2003) and successive convex approximation, we give non-asymptotic stationary-point convergence guarantees for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) objective associated with weight-sharing via algorithms that simultaneously connect to the underlying problem structure and handle the alternating-block nature of the architecture search. Our guarantees inform the design of gradient-based weight-sharing methods by explicitly quantifying the impact of optimizing in the right geometry on convergence rates. 2. What are the generalization benefits of solving a bilevel optimization for the architecture search problem commonly considered in practice? At its core, the goal of architecture search is to find a configuration that achieves good generalization performance. Consequently, a bilevel objective that optimizes the architecture weights using a separate validation loss is commonly used in practice in lieu of the ERM objective naturally induced by weight sharing (Pham et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019) . The learning aspects of this approach have generally been studied in settings with much stronger control over the model complexity (Kearns et al., 1997) . We provide generalization guarantees for this objective over structured hypothesis spaces associated with a finite set of architectures; this leads to meaningful bounds for simple feature map selection problems as well as insightful results for the NAS problem that depend on the size of the space of global optima. To validate our theoretical results, we conduct empirical studies of weight-sharing in two settings: (1) shallow feature map selection, i.e., tuning the hyperparameters of kernel classification and NLP featurization pipelines, and (2) CNN neural architecture search. In (1) we demonstrate that weightsharing efficiently optimizes the bilevel objective and achieves low generalization error with respect to the best architecture setting. For (2), motivated by insights from our convergence analysis, we develop a simple exponentiated gradient version of DARTS called EDARTS that better exploits the geometry of the optimization problem. We evaluate EDARTS on the design of CNN architectures for CIFAR-10 and demonstrate that EDARTS finds better architectures than DARTS in less than half the time. We also achieve very competitive results relative to state-of-the-art architectures when using an extended evaluation routine. Related Work: Our work on optimization for weight-sharing benefits from the literature on firstorder stochastic optimization (Hazan and Kale, 2014; Beck, 2017) and in particular the mirror descent framework (Beck and Teboulle, 2003) . Specifically, we use successive convex approximation (Razaviyayn et al., 2013; Mairal, 2015) to show convergence of alternating minimization and derive geometry-dependent rates comparable to existing work on non-convex stochastic mirror descent (Dang and Lan, 2015; Zhang and He, 2018) . Our result generalizes to the constrained, nonEuclidean, and multi-block setting an approach of Agarwal et al. (2019) for obtaining non-convex convergence from strongly convex minimization, which may be of independent interest. Previous optimization results for NAS have generally only shown bounds on auxiliary quantities such as regret that are not well-connected to the learning objective Carlucci et al., 2019) or have only given monotonic improvement or asymptotic guarantees (Akimoto et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2019) . However, due to the generality of mirror descent, the approaches in the middle three papers can be seen as special cases of our analysis. Finally, our analysis of the properties of the bilevel optimization is related to work on model selection (Vuong, 1989; Kearns et al., 1997) , but does not consider the configuration parameters as explicit controls on the model complexity. Our learning results are broadly related to hyperparameter optimization, although most work focuses on algorithmic and not statistical questions (Li et al., 2018; Kandasamy et al., 2017) .",

ComplexValued neural networks have been sucessfully applied to a variety of tasks specifically in signal processing where the input data has a natural interpretation in the complex domain.In most publications complex-valued neural networks are compared to real-valued architectures. We need to ensure that these architectures are comparable in their ability to approximate functions. A common metric for their capacity are the number of real-valued parameters. The number of parameters of complex-valued neural networks are rarely studied aspects. While complex numbers increase the computational complexity, their introduction also assumes a certain structure between weights and input. Hence, it is not sufficient to increase the number of parameters.Even more important than in real-valued networks is the choice of activation function for each layer. We test 5 functions: identity or no activation function, rectifier linear unit, hyperbolic tangent, magnitude, squared magnitude.

        "article": "Work on the problem of contextualized word representation\u2014the development of reusable neural network components for sentence understanding\u2014has recently seen a  surge of progress centered on the unsupervised pretraining task of language modeling with methods like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). This paper contributes the first large-scale systematic study comparing different pretraining tasks in this context, both as complements to language modeling and as potential alternatives. The primary results of the study support the use of language modeling as a pretraining task and set a new state of the art among comparable models using multitask learning with language models. However, a closer look at these results reveals worryingly strong baselines and strikingly varied results across target tasks, suggesting that the widely-used paradigm of pretraining and freezing sentence encoders may not be an ideal platform for further work.\n InputFigure 1: Our common model design: During pretraining, we train the shared encoder and the task-specific model for each pretraining task. We then freeze the shared encoder and train the task-specific model anew for each target evaluation task. Tasks may involve more than one sentence.State-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like translation, question answering, and parsing include components intended to extract representations for the meaning and contents of each input sentence. These sentence encoder components are typically trained directly for the target task at hand. This approach can be effective on data rich tasks and yields human performance on some narrowly-defined benchmarks BID35 BID13 , but it is tenable only for the few NLP tasks with millions of examples of training data. This has prompted interest in pretraining for sentence encoding: There is good reason to believe it should be possible to exploit outside data and training signals to effectively pretrain these encoders, both because they are intended to primarily capture sentence meaning rather than any task-specific skill, and because we have seen dramatic successes with pretraining in the related domains of word embeddings and image encoders BID46 .More concretely, four recent papers show that pretrained sentence encoders can yield very strong performance on NLP tasks. First , McCann et al. (2017) show that a BiLSTM encoder from a neural machine translation (MT) system can be effectively reused elsewhere. BID16 , , and BID33 show that various kinds of encoder pretrained in an unsupervised fashion through generative language modeling (LM) are effective as well. Each paper uses its own evaluation methods, though, making it unclear which pretraining task is most effective or whether multiple pretraining tasks can be productively combined; in the related setting of sentence-to-vector encoding, multitask learning with multiple labeled datasets has yielded a robust state of the art BID39 . This paper attempts to systematically address these questions. We train reusable sentence encoders on 17 different pretraining tasks, several simple baselines, and several combinations of these tasks, all using a single model architecture and procedure for pretraining and transfer, inspired by ELMo. We then evaluate each of these encoders on the nine target language understanding tasks in the GLUE benchmark BID41 , yielding a total of 40 sentence encoders and 360 total trained models. We then measure correlation in performance across target tasks and plot learning curves evaluating the effect of training data volume on each pretraining and target tasks.Looking to the results of this experiment, we find that language modeling is the most effective single pretraining task we study, and that multitask learning during pretraining can offer further gains and a new state-of-the-art among fixed sentence encoders. We also , however, find reasons to worry that ELMo-style pretraining, in which we pretrain a model and use it on target tasks with no further fine-tuning, is brittle and seriously limiting: (i) Trivial baseline representations do nearly as well as the best pretrained encoders, and the margins between substantially different pretraining tasks can be extremely small. (ii) Different target tasks differ dramatically on what kinds of pretraining they benefit most from, and multitask pretraining is not sufficient to circumvent this problem and offer general-purpose pretrained encoders. This paper presents a systematic comparison of tasks and task-combinations for the pretraining of sentence-level BiLSTM encoders like those seen in ELMo and CoVe. With 40 pretraining tasks and task combinations (not counting many more ruled out early) and nine target tasks, this represents a far more comprehensive study than any seen on this problem to date.Our chief positive results are perhaps unsurprising: Language modeling works well as a pretraining task, and no other single task is consistently better. Multitask pretraining can produce results better than any single task can, and sets a new state-of-the-art among comparable models. Target task performance continues to improve with the addition of more language model data, even at large scales, suggesting that further work scaling up language model pretraining is warranted.However, a closer look at our results suggests that the pretrain-and-freeze paradigm that underlies ELMo and CoVe might not be a sound platform for future work: Some trivial baselines do strikingly well, the margins between pretraining tasks are small, and some pretraining configurations (such as MNLI E ) yield better performance with less data. This suggests that we may be nearing an upper bound on the performance that can be reached with methods like these.In addition, different tasks benefit from different forms of pretraining to a striking degree-with correlations between target tasks often low or negative-and multitask pretraining tasks fail to reliably produce models better than their best individual components. This suggests that if truly generalpurpose sentence encoders are possible, our current methods cannot produce them.While further work on language modeling seems straightforward and worthwhile, the author(s) of this paper believe that the future of this line of work will require a better understanding of the ways in which neural network target task models can benefit from outside knowledge and data, and new methods for pretraining and transfer learning to allow them to do so.",

A common way to train them is using an approach called cross-entropy loss minimization. This research shows that when training linear classifiers (simple machine learning models) on data that lies in a low-dimensional space using cross-entropy loss, the decision boundary learned can end up being very close to the training data points. \n\nThis is an issue because it means the model has a small margin of error - it can misclassify data points that are only slightly different from the training data. This vulnerability to small perturbations is related to the phenomenon of \"adversarial examples\" where machine learning models fail on inputs that seem identical to humans.\n\nThe researchers propose an alternative training method called \"differential training\" that aims to maximize the margin or distance between the decision boundary and data points of different classes. They prove that differential training achieves the maximum possible margin for linear classifiers.\n\nIncreasing the margin could make models more robust to adversarial attacks and perturbations in the data. The low dimensionality of data is identified as one root cause for why cross-entropy training yields small margins.

They introduced a new training method called differential training, which defines a loss function on pairs of points from different classes, pushing the decision boundary further away from the training data and improving the network's robustness. Interestingly, they also found that the dimensionality of the training data plays a role, with low-dimensional data being more susceptible to small margins between decision boundaries and data points. The findings suggest that the choice of loss function and training algorithm are critical factors in the network's performance and robustness, providing valuable insights for improving the resilience of neural networks against adversarial examples. This research opens up new directions for enhancing the reliability of AI systems, especially in security-critical applications.\n",
        "article": "Neural networks could misclassify inputs that are slightly different from their training data, which indicates a small margin between their decision boundaries and the training dataset. In this work, we study the binary classification of linearly separable datasets and show that linear classifiers could also have decision boundaries that lie close to their training dataset if cross-entropy loss is used for training. In particular, we show that if the features of the training dataset lie in a low-dimensional affine subspace and the cross-entropy loss is minimized by using a gradient method, the margin between the training points and the decision boundary could be much smaller than the optimal value. This result is contrary to the conclusions of recent related works such as (Soudry et al., 2018), and we identify the reason for this contradiction. In order to improve the margin, we introduce differential training, which is a training paradigm that uses a loss function defined on pairs of points from each class. We show that the decision boundary of a linear classifier trained with differential training indeed achieves the maximum margin. The results reveal the use of cross-entropy loss as one of the hidden culprits of adversarial examples and introduces a new direction to make neural networks robust against them. Training neural networks is challenging and involves making several design choices. Among these are the architecture of the network, the training loss function, the optimization algorithm used for training, and their hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the batch size. Most of these design choices influence the solution obtained by the training procedure and have been studied in detail BID9 BID4 BID5 Wilson et al., 2017; BID17 BID19 . Nevertheless, one choice has been mostly taken for granted when the network is trained for a classification task: the training loss function.Cross-entropy loss function is almost the sole choice for classification tasks in practice. Its prevalent use is backed theoretically by its association with the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical distribution of a dataset and the confidence of the classifier for that dataset. Given the particular success of neural networks for classification tasks BID11 BID18 BID5 , there seems to be little motivation to search for alternatives for this loss function, and most of the software developed for neural networks incorporates an efficient implementation for it, thereby facilitating its use.Recently there has been a line of work analyzing the dynamics of training a linear classifier with the cross-entropy loss function BID15 b; BID7 . They specified the decision boundary that the gradient descent algorithm yields on linearly separable datasets and claimed that this solution achieves the maximum margin.1 However, these claims were observed not to hold in the simple experiments we ran. For example, FIG6 displays a case where the cross-entropy minimization for a linear classifier leads to a decision boundary which attains an extremely poor margin and is nearly orthogonal to the solution given by the hard-margin support vector machine (SVM).We set out to understand this discrepancy between the claims of the previous works and our observations on the simple experiments. We can summarize our contributions as follows. We compare our results with related works and discuss their implications for the following subjects.Adversarial examples. State-of-the-art neural networks have been observed to misclassify inputs that are slightly different from their training data, which indicates a small margin between their decision boundaries and the training dataset (Szegedy et al., 2013; BID3 MoosaviDezfooli et al., 2017; . Our results reveal that the combination of gradient methods, cross-entropy loss function and the low-dimensionality of the training dataset (at least in some domain) has a responsibility for this problem. Note that SVM with the radial basis function was shown to be robust against adversarial examples, and this was attributed to the high nonlinearity of the radial basis function in BID3 . Given that the SVM uses neither the cross entropy loss function nor the gradient descent algorithm for training, we argue that the robustness of SVM is no surprise -independent of its nonlinearity. Lastly, effectiveness of differential training for neural networks against adversarial examples is our ongoing work. The activations feeding into the soft-max layer could be considered as the features for a linear classifier. Plot shows the cumulative variance explained for these features as a function of the number of principle components used. Almost all the variance in the features is captured by the first 20 principle components out of 84, which shows that the input to the soft-max layer resides predominantly in a low-dimensional subspace.Low-dimensionality of the training dataset. As stated in Remark 3, as the dimension of the affine subspace containing the training dataset gets very small compared to the dimension of the input space, the training algorithm will become more likely to yield a small margin for the classifier. This observation confirms the results of BID13 , which showed that if the set of training data is projected onto a low-dimensional subspace before feeding into a neural network, the performance of the network against adversarial examples is improved -since projecting the inputs onto a low-dimensional domain corresponds to decreasing the dimension of the input space. Even though this method is effective, it requires the knowledge of the domain in which the training points are low-dimensional. Because this knowledge will not always be available, finding alternative training algorithms and loss functions that are suited for low-dimensional data is still an important direction for future research.Robust optimization. Using robust optimization techniques to train neural networks has been shown to be effective against adversarial examples BID12 BID0 . Note that these techniques could be considered as inflating the training points by a presumed amount and training the classifier with these inflated points. Consequently, as long as the cross-entropy loss is involved, the decision boundaries of the neural network will still be in the vicinity of the inflated points. Therefore, even though the classifier is robust against the disturbances of the presumed magnitude, the margin of the classifier could still be much smaller than what it could potentially be.Differential training. We introduced differential training, which allows the feature mapping to remain trainable while ensuring a large margin between different classes of points. Therefore, this method combines the benefits of neural networks with those of support vector machines. Even though moving from 2N training points to N 2 seems prohibitive, it points out that a true classification should in fact be able to differentiate between the pairs that are hardest to differentiate, and this search will necessarily require an N 2 term. Some heuristic methods are likely to be effective, such as considering only a smaller subset of points closer to the boundary and updating this set of points as needed during training. If a neural network is trained with this procedure, the network will be forced to find features that are able to tell apart between the hardest pairs.Nonseparable data. What happens when the training data is not linearly separable is an open direction for future work. However, as stated in Remark 4, this case is not expected to arise for the state-of-the-art networks, since they have been shown to achieve zero training error even on randomly generated datasets (Zhang et al., 2017) , which implies that the features represented by the output of their penultimate layer eventually become linearly separable. A PROOF OF THEOREM 1Theorem 1 could be proved by using Theorem 2, but we provide an independent proof here.

Solving the set of equations DISPLAYFORM7 , DISPLAYFORM8 Proof. Note that\u017c \u2265 a/2 andv \u2265 c/2; therefore, DISPLAYFORM9 if either side exists. Remember tha\u1e6b DISPLAYFORM10 We can compute f (w) = 2acw + bcw 2 + ab b 2 w 2 + 2abw + a 2 . The function f is strictly increasing and convex for w > 0. We have DISPLAYFORM11 Therefore, when b \u2265 a, the only fixed point of f over [0, \u221e) is the origin, and when a > b, 0 and (a \u2212 b)/(c \u2212 b) are the only fixed points of f over [0, \u221e). Figure 4 shows the curves over whichu = 0 and\u1e87 = 0. Since lim t\u2192\u221e u = lim t\u2192\u221e w, the only points (u, w) can converge to are the fixed points of f . Remember tha\u1e6b DISPLAYFORM12 so when a > b, the origin (0, 0) is unstable in the sense of Lyapunov, and (u, w) cannot converge to it. Otherwise, (0, 0) is the only fixed point, and it is stable. As a result, DISPLAYFORM13 Figure 4: Stationary points of function f . DISPLAYFORM14 Proof. From Lemma 6 , DISPLAYFORM15 Consequently , DISPLAYFORM16 which gives the same solution as Lemma 5: DISPLAYFORM17 Proof. We can obtain a lower bound for square of the denominator as DISPLAYFORM18 DISPLAYFORM19 As a result, Then, we can write w as DISPLAYFORM20 Remember, by definition, w SVM = arg min w 2 s.t. w, x i + y j \u2265 2 \u2200i \u2208 I, \u2200j \u2208 J.Since the vector u also satisfies u, x i + y j = w, x i + y j \u2265 2 for all i \u2208 I, j \u2208 J, we have u \u2265 w SVM = 1 \u03b3 . As a result, the margin obtained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss is DISPLAYFORM21",

SpectralNet is a neural network model that learns to map data points into an embedding space where spectral clustering can be applied efficiently.

        "article": "Spectral clustering is a leading and popular technique in unsupervised data analysis.   Two of its major limitations are scalability and generalization of the spectral embedding (i.e., out-of-sample-extension). In this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to spectral clustering that overcomes the above shortcomings. Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which are implemented using a special purpose output layer, allow us to keep the network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.   Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of  SpectralNet.   State-of-the-art clustering results are reported for both the MNIST and Reuters datasets.\n Discovering clusters in unlabeled data is a task of significant scientific and practical value. With technological progress images, texts, and other types of data are acquired in large numbers. Their labeling, however, is often expensive, tedious, or requires expert knowledge. Clustering techniques provide useful tools to analyze such data and to reveal its underlying structure.Spectral Clustering BID20 BID16 BID22 ) is a leading and highly popular clustering algorithm. It works by embedding the data in the eigenspace of the Laplacian matrix, derived from the pairwise similarities between data points, and applying k-means to this representation to obtain the clusters. Several properties make spectral clustering appealing: First, its embedding optimizes a natural cost function, minimizing pairwise distances between similar data points; moreover, this optimal embedding can be found analytically. Second, spectral clustering variants arise as relaxations of graph balanced-cut problems BID22 . Third, spectral clustering was shown to outperform other popular clustering algorithms such as k-means DCN, VaDE, DEPICT and IMSAT (bottom) on simulated datasets in 2D and 3D. Our approach successfully finds these non-convex clusters, whereas the competing algorithms fail on all five examples. (The full set of results for these algorithms is shown in FIG4 in Appendix A.) BID22 , arguably due to its ability to handle non-convex clusters. Finally, it has a solid probabilistic interpretation, since the Euclidean distance in the embedding space is equal to a diffusion distance, which, informally, measures the time it takes probability mass to transfer between points, via all the other points in the dataset BID15 BID5 .While spectral embedding of data points can be achieved by a simple eigen-decomposition of their graph Laplacian matrix, with large datasets direct computation of eigenvectors may be prohibitive. Moreover , generalizing a spectral embedding to unseen data points, a task commonly referred to as out-of-sample-extension (OOSE), is a non-trivial task; see, for example, BID1 BID2 BID9 BID6 ).In this work we introduce SpectralNet, a deep learning approach to spectral clustering, which addresses the scalability and OOSE problems pointed above. Specifically , SpectralNet is trained in a stochastic fashion, which allows it to scale. Moreover, once trained, it provides a function, implemented as a feed-forward network, that maps each input data point to its spectral embedding coordinates. This map can easily be applied to new test data. Unlike optimization of standard deep learning models, SpectralNet is trained using constrained optimization, where the constraint (orthogonality of the net outputs) is enforced by adding a linear layer, whose weights are set by the QR decomposition of its inputs. In addition, as good affinity functions are crucial for the success of spectral clustering, rather than using the common Euclidean distance to compute Gaussian affinity, we show how Siamese networks can be trained from the given unlabeled data to learn more informative pairwise distances and consequently significantly improve the quality of the clustering. Further improvement can be achieved if our network is applied to transformed data obtained by an autoencoder (AE). On the theoretical front, we utilize VC-dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of neural networks that compute spectral clustering. Our experiments indicate that our network indeed approximates the Laplacian eigenvectors well, allowing the network to cluster challenging non-convex point sets, which recent deep network based methods fail to handle; see examples in Figure 1. Finally, SpetralNet achieves competitive performance on MNIST handwritten digit dataset and state-of-the-art on the Reuters document dataset, whose size makes standard spectral clustering inapplicable. We have introduced SpectralNet, a deep learning approach for approximate spectral clustering. The stochastic training of SpectralNet allows us to scale to larger datasets than what vanilla spectral clustering can handle, and the parametric map obtained from the net enables straightforward out of sample extension. In addition, we propose to use unsupervised Siamese networks to compute distances, and empirically show that this results in better performance, comparing to standard Euclidean distances. Further improvement are achieved by applying our network to code representations produced with a standard stacked autoencoder. We present a novel analysis of the VC dimension of spectral clustering, and derive a lower bound on the size of neural nets that compute it. In addition, we report state of the art results on two benchmark datasets, and show that SpectralNet outperforms existing methods when the clusters cannot be contained in non overlapping convex shapes. We believe the integration of spectral clustering with deep learning provides a useful tool for unsupervised deep learning.",
