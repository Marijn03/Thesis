Aspects:
- Language: low level of complex terms (1:Chatgpt, 2: claude, 3:cohere)
- Clarity and coherence: clear structure or explanation of the concepts in the paper (1:Claude, 1:Cohere, 1:chatgpt))
- Detail: provide sufficient detail on the experimental results and significance of the findings (1:Claude, 1:Cohere, 1:chatgpt)
- Confusing language: vague language like “They fixed a thing called loss scaling” (1:Cohere, 1:Claude, 3:chatgpt) 
ChatGPT: These (0), they (1)
Claude: These (0), they (0)
Cohere: These (0), they (0)


Important topics: 
- Deep Graph Infomax 
- unsupervised learning with GCNs, DGI does not rely on random walk objectives, and is readily applicable to both transductive and inductive learning setups
- competitive performance on a variety of node classification benchmarks

Chatgpt: It is not mentioning the unsupervised part of DGI and "even when they are explicitly taught" is not stated in text.

Cohere: the sentence "maximizes mutual information between patch representations in graph-structured data." is not easy to understand.

Claude: It includes important concepts and explaining difficult concepts (node classification)

Overall rank: 1: Claude, 2: Chatgpt, 3:Cohere

Evaluation
Cohere was too difficult, chatgpt was missing unsupervised part of DGI and was mentioning "explicit teaching" whereas that was not stated in text
