Aspects:
- Language: low level of complex terms (1: Chatgpt, 2: Claude, 3: Cohere)
- Clarity and coherence: clear structure or explanation of the concepts in the paper (1: Claude, 2:Cohere, 3:Chatgpt)
- Detail: provide sufficient detail on the experimental results and significance of the findings (1:Claude, 2:Cohere, 3:Chatgpt)
- Confusing language: vague language like “They fixed a thing called loss scaling” (1:Claude, 2: Cohere, 3: Chatgpt) 
ChatGPT: These (0), they (4)
Claude: These (0), they (1)
Cohere: These (0), they (2)

Important topics: 
- binary classification of linearly separable datasets and show that linear classifiers could also have decision boundaries that lie close to their training dataset
- differential training
- gradient methods, cross-entropy loss function and the low-dimensionality of the training dataset have responsibility for misclassification
- adversarial examples

Chatgpt: It is giving example to explain the concept. However, 'specifically in tasks like sorting things into categories.' is not directly mentioned in the text
- 'numbers to represent things and giving them rules to follow' is not clear
- not mentioning the cause of misclassification
- missing the term 'adversarial examples' 
- not discussing linear classifiers

Cohere: 
- "pushing the decision boundary further away from the training data" difficult to comprehend
- not mentioning the gradient classifiers as cause for misclassification for adversarial examples
- could have used paragraphs

Claude: saying "small margin of error" and also explaining what this means
- not mentioning the gradient classifiers as cause for misclassification for adversarial examples

Overal rank: 1:Claude, 2: Chatgpt , 3:Cohere

Evaluation
Chatgpt uses vague language "sorting things into categories" and misses detail. Claude has a clear structure, explains difficult words and is detailed. Cohere is using difficult words (not explaining them), could have paragraphs but is explaining the important concepts.
