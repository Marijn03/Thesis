Important topics: 
- contextualized word representation
- comparing different pretraining tasks in this context
- language modeling is the most effective single pretraining task 
- multitask learning during pretraining can offer further gains 
- Multitask pretraining can produce results better than any single task can

Chatgpt: It is mentioning concept of contextualized word representation but not explicit mentioning it. There is a hallucination: 'to predict the next word in a sentence (language modeling)'. Text is only talking about 'language modeling as a pretraining task'. It is not explaining what research is about. Instead of the phrase "some tasks benefit", it could have mentioned example like 'multitask training'. 

Cohere: It is explicitly mentioning target audience and the prompt which is makes summary worse.

Claude: It gives a clear explanation of concepts. There is a hallucination: 'to predict the next word in a sentence (language modeling)'. Text is only talking about 'language modeling as a pretraining task'. 

Overall ranking: 1:Claude, 1:Cohere, 3:Chatgpt

Evaluation
Claude and chatgpt both explained language modeling in a way that was not stated in the article. Claude explained the concepts in detail and structured way. Cohere and chatgpt are missing some detail.
