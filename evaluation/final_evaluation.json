This is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Current models struggle to detect OOD samples reliably.

By measuring the distance of a test sample from these class distributions, the model can better identify OOD samples while still accurately classifying in-distribution data.

This research contributes to the field of AI by providing a more robust and adaptable classification system, offering potential benefits for real-world applications.\n",
        "article": "The capability of reliably detecting out-of-distribution samples is one of the key factors in deploying a good classifier, as the test distribution always does not match with the training distribution in most real-world applications. In this work, we propose a deep generative classifier which is effective to detect out-of-distribution samples as well as classify in-distribution samples, by integrating the concept of Gaussian discriminant analysis into deep neural networks. Unlike the discriminative (or softmax) classifier that only focuses on the decision boundary partitioning its latent space into multiple regions, our generative classifier aims to explicitly model class-conditional distributions as separable Gaussian distributions. Thereby, we can define the confidence score by the distance between a test sample and the center of each distribution. Our empirical evaluation on multi-class images and tabular data demonstrate that the generative classifier achieves the best performances in distinguishing out-of-distribution samples, and also it can be generalized well for various types of deep neural networks. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, also known as novelty detection, refers to the task of identifying the samples that differ in some respect from the training samples. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) turned out to show unpredictable behaviors in case of mismatch between the training and testing data distributions; for example, they tend to make high confidence prediction for the samples that are drawn from OOD or belong to unseen classes (Szegedy et al., 2014; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017) . For this reason, accurately measuring the distributional uncertainty (Malinin & Gales, 2018) of DNNs becomes one of the important challenges in many real-world applications where we can hardly control the testing data distribution. Several recent studies have tried to simply detect OOD samples using the confidence score defined by softmax probability (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017; Liang et al., 2018) or Mahalanobis distance from class means (Lee et al., 2018) , and they showed promising results even without re-training the model. However, all of them employ the DNNs designed for a discriminative (or softmax) classifier, which has limited power to locate OOD samples distinguishable with in-distribution (ID) samples in their latent space. To be specific, the softmax classifier is optimized to learn the discriminative latent space where the training samples are aligned along their corresponding class weight vectors, maximizing the softmax probability for the target classes. As pointed out in (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017) , OOD samples are more likely to have small values of the softmax probability for all known classes, which means that their latent vectors get closer to the origin. As a result, there could be a large overlap between two sets of ID and OOD samples in the latent space (Figure 1 ), which eventually reduces the gap between their confidence scores and degrades the performance as well. In addition, most of existing confidence scores adopt additional calibration techniques Hinton et al., 2015) to enhance the reliability of the detection, but they include several hyperparameters whose optimal values vary depending on the testing data distribution. In this situation, they utilized a small portion of each test set (containing both ID and OOD samples) for validation, and reported the results evaluated on the rest by using the optimal hyperparameter values for each test case. Considering the motivation of OOD detection that prior knowledge of test distributions is not available before we encounter them, such process of tuning the hyperparameters for each test case is not practical when deploying the DNNs in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel objective to train DNNs with a generative (or distance) classifier which is capable of effectively identifying OOD test samples. The main difference of our deep generative classifier is to learn separable class-conditional distributions in the latent space, by explicitly modeling them as a DNN layer. The generative classifier places OOD samples further apart from the distributions of all given classes, without utilizing OOD samples for its validation. Thus, based on the Euclidean distance between a test sample and the centers of the obtained class-conditional distributions, we can calculate how likely and how confidently the sample belongs to each class. This can be interpreted as a multi-class extension of unsupervised anomaly detection (Ruff et al., 2018) , and Gaussian discriminant analysis provides the theoretical background for incorporating the generative classifier into the DNNs. Our extensive experiments on images and tabular data demonstrate that the proposed classifier distinguishes OOD samples more accurately than the state-of-the-art method, while maintaining the classification accuracy for ID samples. This paper introduces a deep learning objective to learn the multi-class generative classifier, by fusing the concept of Gaussian discriminant analysis with DNNs. Unlike the conventional softmax classifier, our generative (or distance) classifier learns the class-conditional distributions to be separated from each other and follow the Gaussian distribution at the same time, thus it is able to effectively distinguish OOD samples from ID samples. We empirically show that our confidence score beats other competing methods in detecting both OOD tabular data and OOD images, and also the distance classifier can be easily combined with various types of DNNs to further improve their performances.",

What functions do these shared anatomical and functional features serve, and are they optimal for odor sensing? In this study, we address the optimality of evolutionary design in olfactory circuits by studying artificial neural networks trained to sense odors. We found that artificial neural networks quantitatively recapitulate structures inherent in the olfactory system, including the formation of glomeruli onto a compression layer and sparse and random connectivity onto an expansion layer. Finally, we offer theoretical justifications for each result. Our work offers a framework to explain the evolutionary convergence of olfactory circuits, and gives insight and logic into the anatomic and functional structure of the olfactory system. Over the last two decades, both the anatomic and functional organization of the fly and mouse olfactory systems have been mapped to excruciating detail, affording knowledge of how odors are processed along the entirety of olfactory pathway. In both model organisms, the layout of the olfactory system is two layers deep and comprises of a compression layer and an expansion layer. Olfactory perception is initiated by the recognition of odorants by a large repertoire of receptors in the sensory epithelium (Buck & Axel, 1991) . In fruit flies, individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express only one of 50 different olfactory receptors (ORs), and all neurons (10 on average) that express the same receptor converge with precision onto a unique set of 2-4 projection neurons (PNs) through a specialized structure known as an olfactory glomerulus (Vosshall, Wong, & Axel, 2000) . This layout establishes a one-to-one mapping between ORs and PNs. Information is then conveyed to an expansion layer of 2,500 Kenyon Cells (KCs) through sparse and random connectivity to support a high dimensional representation of odor information before it is classified by 20 read-out neurons, the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs). Experiments reveal that synaptic plasticity at the KC-MBON synapse is necessary and causal in odor learning. The only major differences between the circuits of mice and flies appear to be numerical. Whereas the fly olfactory system consists of 50 ORs, 50 glomeruli, and 2500 KCs, the mouse olfactory system consists of 1500 ORs, 1500 glomeruli, and 1 million piriform neurons. The fact that evolution has evolved to hardwire the same architecture in flies, mice, and multiple other organisms suggests that such an architecture is optimal for the general task of odor sensing. Although we have a detailed anatomy of the olfactory system in both flies and mice, it is unclear why certain features are optimal for odor sensing. In particular, 1) why does every ORN express a single OR, 2) why is information preserved through a one-to-one mapping between ORs and PNs, and 3) why is connectivity onto the expansion layer sparse and random (Litwin-Kumar, Harris, Axel, Sompolinsky, & Abbott, 2017)? To study optimal circuit design, we use a goal-driven approach to train an artificial neural network to classify odors and then analyze the anatomical and functional structures that emerge after training. This approach has recently been used to study the functional profiles of the ventral stream in visual object processing (Yamins & DiCarlo, 2016) . The simplicity of the fly olfactory circuit and the exhaustive knowledge that we have of its anatomy provides constraints that can be used to gain insight into evolutionary design. We trained artificial neural networks using stochastic gradient descent to classify odors. We found that glomeruli emerged in PN layer, and sparse random connectivity emerges in the PN to KC connections. We then explored the sufficient conditions that enabled these features to emerge. We found that the formation of glomeruli did not depend on input noise but rather on the existence of an expansion layer downstream. In addition, we found that an expansion layer with a synaptic degree of 7 endows the olfactory system with robustness by allowing for large tolerances in synaptic efficacies without affecting task performance. Our work offers a framework to explain the Optimal K predicted by maximal weight robustness (red) and direct training (plus signs). The line is a power-law fit of the red dots.",

        "article": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly trained using a fixed spatial image size predetermined for a given model. Although trained on images of a specific size, it is well established that CNNs can be used to evaluate a wide range of image sizes at test time, by adjusting the size of intermediate feature maps. \n In this work, we describe and evaluate a novel mixed-size training regime that mixes several image sizes at training time. We demonstrate that models trained using our method are more resilient to image size changes and generalize well even on small images. This allows faster inference by using smaller images at test time. For instance, we receive a 76.43% top-1 accuracy using ResNet50 with an image size of 160, which matches the accuracy of the baseline model with 2x fewer computations.\n Furthermore, for a given image size used at test time, we show this method can be exploited either to accelerate training or the final test accuracy. For example, we are able to reach a 79.27% accuracy with a model evaluated at a 288 spatial size for a relative improvement of 14% over the baseline. Figure 1: Test accuracy per image size, models trained on specific sizes (ResNet50, ImageNet). Convolutional neural networks are successfully used to solve various tasks across multiple domains such as visual (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2015) , audio (van den Oord et al., 2016) , language (Gehring et al., 2017) and speech (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2014) . While scale-invariance is considered important for visual representations (Lowe, 1999) , convolutional networks are not scale invariant with respect to the spatial resolution of the image input, as a change in image dimension may lead to a non-linear change of their output. Even though CNNs are able to achieve state-of-theart results in many tasks and domains, their sensitivity to the image size is an inherent deficiency that limits practical use cases and requires evaluation inputs to match training image size. For example, Touvron et al. (2019) demonstrated that networks trained on specific image size, perform poorly on other image sizes at evaluation, as shown in Figure 1 . Several works attempted to achieve scale invariance by modifying the network structure (Xu et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2017) . However, the most common method is to artificially enlarge the dataset using a set of label-preserving transformations also known as \"data augmentation\" (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Howard, 2013) . Several of these transformations scale and crop objects appearing within the data, thus increasing the network's robustness to inputs of different scale. Although not explicitly trained to handle varying image sizes, CNNs are commonly evaluated on multiple scales post training, such as in the case of detection (Lin et al., 2017; Redmon & Farhadi, 2018) and segmentation (He et al., 2017) tasks. In these tasks, a network that was pretrained with fixed image size for classification is used as the backbone of a larger model that is expected to adapt to a wide variety of image sizes. In this work, we will introduce a novel training regime, \"MixSize\" for convolutional networks that uses stochastic image and batch sizes. The main contributions of the MixSize regime are: \u2022 Reducing image size sensitivity. We show that the MixSize training regime can improve model performance on a wide range of sizes used at evaluation. \u2022 Faster inference. As our mixed-size models can be evaluated at smaller image sizes, we show up to 2\u00d7 reduction in computations required at inference to reach the same accuracy as the baseline model. \u2022 Faster training vs. high accuracy. We show that reducing the average image size at training leads to a trade-off between the time required to train the model and its final accuracy. 2 RELATED WORK",

        "article": "Work on the problem of contextualized word representation\u2014the development of reusable neural network components for sentence understanding\u2014has recently seen a  surge of progress centered on the unsupervised pretraining task of language modeling with methods like ELMo (Peters et al., 2018). This paper contributes the first large-scale systematic study comparing different pretraining tasks in this context, both as complements to language modeling and as potential alternatives. The primary results of the study support the use of language modeling as a pretraining task and set a new state of the art among comparable models using multitask learning with language models. However, a closer look at these results reveals worryingly strong baselines and strikingly varied results across target tasks, suggesting that the widely-used paradigm of pretraining and freezing sentence encoders may not be an ideal platform for further work.\n InputFigure 1: Our common model design: During pretraining, we train the shared encoder and the task-specific model for each pretraining task. We then freeze the shared encoder and train the task-specific model anew for each target evaluation task. Tasks may involve more than one sentence.State-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like translation, question answering, and parsing include components intended to extract representations for the meaning and contents of each input sentence. These sentence encoder components are typically trained directly for the target task at hand. This approach can be effective on data rich tasks and yields human performance on some narrowly-defined benchmarks BID35 BID13 , but it is tenable only for the few NLP tasks with millions of examples of training data. This has prompted interest in pretraining for sentence encoding: There is good reason to believe it should be possible to exploit outside data and training signals to effectively pretrain these encoders, both because they are intended to primarily capture sentence meaning rather than any task-specific skill, and because we have seen dramatic successes with pretraining in the related domains of word embeddings and image encoders BID46 .More concretely, four recent papers show that pretrained sentence encoders can yield very strong performance on NLP tasks. First , McCann et al. (2017) show that a BiLSTM encoder from a neural machine translation (MT) system can be effectively reused elsewhere. BID16 , , and BID33 show that various kinds of encoder pretrained in an unsupervised fashion through generative language modeling (LM) are effective as well. Each paper uses its own evaluation methods, though, making it unclear which pretraining task is most effective or whether multiple pretraining tasks can be productively combined; in the related setting of sentence-to-vector encoding, multitask learning with multiple labeled datasets has yielded a robust state of the art BID39 . This paper attempts to systematically address these questions. We train reusable sentence encoders on 17 different pretraining tasks, several simple baselines, and several combinations of these tasks, all using a single model architecture and procedure for pretraining and transfer, inspired by ELMo. We then evaluate each of these encoders on the nine target language understanding tasks in the GLUE benchmark BID41 , yielding a total of 40 sentence encoders and 360 total trained models. We then measure correlation in performance across target tasks and plot learning curves evaluating the effect of training data volume on each pretraining and target tasks.Looking to the results of this experiment, we find that language modeling is the most effective single pretraining task we study, and that multitask learning during pretraining can offer further gains and a new state-of-the-art among fixed sentence encoders. We also , however, find reasons to worry that ELMo-style pretraining, in which we pretrain a model and use it on target tasks with no further fine-tuning, is brittle and seriously limiting: (i) Trivial baseline representations do nearly as well as the best pretrained encoders, and the margins between substantially different pretraining tasks can be extremely small. (ii) Different target tasks differ dramatically on what kinds of pretraining they benefit most from, and multitask pretraining is not sufficient to circumvent this problem and offer general-purpose pretrained encoders. This paper presents a systematic comparison of tasks and task-combinations for the pretraining of sentence-level BiLSTM encoders like those seen in ELMo and CoVe. With 40 pretraining tasks and task combinations (not counting many more ruled out early) and nine target tasks, this represents a far more comprehensive study than any seen on this problem to date.Our chief positive results are perhaps unsurprising: Language modeling works well as a pretraining task, and no other single task is consistently better. Multitask pretraining can produce results better than any single task can, and sets a new state-of-the-art among comparable models. Target task performance continues to improve with the addition of more language model data, even at large scales, suggesting that further work scaling up language model pretraining is warranted.However, a closer look at our results suggests that the pretrain-and-freeze paradigm that underlies ELMo and CoVe might not be a sound platform for future work: Some trivial baselines do strikingly well, the margins between pretraining tasks are small, and some pretraining configurations (such as MNLI E ) yield better performance with less data. This suggests that we may be nearing an upper bound on the performance that can be reached with methods like these.In addition, different tasks benefit from different forms of pretraining to a striking degree-with correlations between target tasks often low or negative-and multitask pretraining tasks fail to reliably produce models better than their best individual components. This suggests that if truly generalpurpose sentence encoders are possible, our current methods cannot produce them.While further work on language modeling seems straightforward and worthwhile, the author(s) of this paper believe that the future of this line of work will require a better understanding of the ways in which neural network target task models can benefit from outside knowledge and data, and new methods for pretraining and transfer learning to allow them to do so.",

        "article": "Capsule Networks have shown encouraging results on defacto benchmark computer vision datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR and smallNORB. Although, they are yet to be tested on tasks where (1) the entities detected inherently have more complex internal representations and (2) there are very few instances per class to learn from and (3) where point-wise classification is not suitable. Hence, this paper carries out experiments on face verification in both controlled and uncontrolled settings that together address these points. In doing so we introduce Siamese Capsule Networks, a new variant that can be used for pairwise learning tasks. The model is trained using contrastive loss with l2-normalized capsule encoded pose features. We find that Siamese Capsule Networks perform well against strong baselines on both pairwise learning datasets, yielding best results in the few-shot learning setting where image pairs in the test set contain unseen subjects. Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) have been a mainstay model for a wide variety of tasks in computer vision. CNNs are effective at detecting local features in the receptive field, although the spatial relationship between features is lost when crude routing operations are performed to achieve translation invariance, as is the case with max and average pooling. Essentially, pooling results in viewpoint invariance so that small perturbations in the input do not effect the output. This leads to a significant loss of information about the internal properties of present entities (e.g location, orientation, shape and pose) in an image and relationships between them. The issue is usually combated by having large amounts of annotated data from a wide variety of viewpoints, albeit redundant and less efficient in many cases. As noted by hinton1985shape, from a psychology perspective of human shape perception, pooling does not account for the coordinate frames imposed on objects when performing mental rotation to identify handedness BID20 ; BID16 BID10 . Hence, the scalar output activities from local kernel regions that summarize sets of local inputs are not sufficient for preserving reference frames that are used in human perception, since viewpoint information is discarded. Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) BID11 have acknowledged the issue by using dynamic spatial transformations on feature mappings to enhance the geometric invariance of the model, although this approach addresses changes in viewpoint by learning to remove rotational and scale variance, as opposed to viewpoint variance being reflected in the model activations. Instead of addressing translation invariance using pooling operations, BID6 have worked on achieving translation equivariance.The recently proposed Capsule Networks BID21 ; BID5 have shown encouraging results to address these challenges. Thus far, Capsule Networks have only been tested on datasets that have (1) a relatively sufficient number of instances per class to learn from and (2) utilized on tasks in the standard classification setup. This paper extends Capsule Networks to the pairwise learning setting to learn relationships between whole entity encodings, while also demonstrating their ability to learn from little data that can perform few-shot learning where instances from new classes arise during testing (i.e zero-shot prediction). The Siamese Capsule Network is trained using a contrastive loss with 2 -normalized encoded features and demonstrated on two face verification tasks. BID6 first introduced the idea of using whole vectors to represent internal properties (referred to as instantiation parameters that include pose) of an entity with an associated activation probability where each capsule represents a single instance of an entity within in an image. This differs from the single scalar outputs in conventional neural networks where pooling is used as a crude routing operation over filters. Pooling performs sub-sampling so that neurons are invariant to viewpoint change, instead capsules look to preserve the information to achieve equivariance, akin to perceptual systems. Hence, pooling is replaced with a dynamic routing scheme to send lowerlevel capsule (e.g nose, mouth, ears etc.) outputs as input to parent capsule (e.g face) that represent part-whole relationships to achieve translation equivariance and untangles the coordinate frame of an entity through linear transformations. The idea has its roots in computer graphics where images are rendered given an internal hierarchical representation, for this reason the brain is hypothesized to solve an inverse graphics problem where given an image the cortex deconstructs it to its latent hierarchical properties. The original paper by BID21 describes a dynamic routing scheme that represent these internal representations as vectors given a group of designated neurons called capsules, which consist of a pose vector u \u2208 R d and activation \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1]. The architecture consists of two convolutional layers that are used as the initial input representations for the first capsule layer that are then routed to a final class capsule layer. The initial convolutional layers allow learned knowledge from local feature representations to be reused and replicated in other parts of the receptive field. The capsule inputs are determined using a Iterative Dynamic Routing scheme. A transformation W ij is made to output vector u i of capsule C L i . The length of the vector u i represents the probability that this lower-level capsule detected a given object and the direction corresponds to the state of the object (e.g orientation, position or relationship to upper capsule). The output vector u i is transformed into a prediction vector\u00fb j|i , where\u00fb j|i = W ij u i . Then,\u00fb j|i is weighted by a coupling coefficient c ij to obtain s j = i c ij\u00fbj|i , where coupling coefficients for each capsule j c ij = 1 and c ij is got by log prior probabilities b ij from a sigmoid function, followed by the softmax, c ij = e bij / k e b ik . If\u00fb L j|i has high scalar magnitude when multiplied by u L+1 j then the coupling coefficient c ij is increased and the remaining potential parent capsules coupling coefficients are decreased. Routing By Agreement is then performed using coincidence filtering to find tight clusters of nearby predictions. The entities output vector length is represented as the probability of an entity being present by using the nonlinear normalization shown in Equation 1 where vote v j is the output from total input s j , which is then used to compute the agreement a ij = v j\u00fbj|i that is added to the log prior b ij . This paper has introduced the Siamese Capsule Network, a novel architecture that extends Capsule Networks to the pairwise learning setting with a feature 2 -normalized contrastive loss that maximizes inter-class variance and minimizes intra-class variance. The results indicate Capsule Networks perform better at learning from only few examples and converge faster when a contrastive loss is used that takes face embeddings in the form of encoded capsule pose vectors. We find Siamese Capsule Networks to perform particularly well on the AT&T dataset in the few-shot learning setting, which is tested on unseen classes (i.e subjects) during testing, while competitive against baselines for the larger Labeled Faces In The Wild dataset.",

Think of it like a smart teacher passing on their wisdom to a student. But here's the twist: the way they learn can be improved! Scientists realized that by giving the teacher and student different examples to learn from, the student can understand better. It's like customizing lessons for each student in class. By using this new approach, the student can learn even more efficiently, especially when the teacher is super smart but the student needs simpler lessons. This discovery could lead to smarter, more efficient computer programs in the future. So, in a nutshell, KD helps make computers smarter by giving them better lessons tailored just for them.\n",

        "article": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common method for transferring the ``knowledge'' learned by one machine learning model (the teacher) into another model (the student), where typically, the teacher has a greater capacity (e.g., more parameters or higher bit-widths). To our knowledge, existing methods overlook the fact that although the student absorbs extra knowledge from the teacher, both models share the same input data -- and this data is the only medium by which the teacher's knowledge can be demonstrated. Due to the difference in model capacities, the student may not benefit fully from the same data points on which the teacher is trained. On the other hand, a human teacher may demonstrate a piece of knowledge with individualized examples adapted to a particular student, for instance, in terms of her cultural background and interests. Inspired by this behavior, we design data augmentation agents with distinct roles to facilitate knowledge distillation. Our data augmentation agents generate distinct training data for the teacher and student, respectively. We focus specifically on KD when the teacher network has greater precision (bit-width) than the student network.\n\n We find empirically that specially tailored data points enable the teacher's knowledge to be demonstrated more effectively to the student. We compare our approach with existing KD methods on training popular neural architectures and demonstrate that role-wise data augmentation improves the effectiveness of KD over strong prior approaches. The code for reproducing our results will be made publicly available. Background and Motivation. In the educational psychology literature, it is generally considered beneficial if teachers can adapt curricula based upon students' prior experiences (Bandura, 2002; Brumfiel, 2005; Gurlitt et al., 2006; Slotta & Chi, 2006) . These vary widely depending on students' cultural backgrounds, previous educational experiences, interests, and motivations. To help students with different prior experiences to comprehend, memorise, and consolidate a piece of knowledge, teachers may provide extra and customized teaching material during their teaching processes. For instance, when teaching the concept of the color pink, a teacher may choose flamingos, sakura (cherry blossoms), or ice cream cones as the example, depending on a student's background. Knowledge distillation (KD) (Bucilua et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2014 ) is a common framework for training machine learning models. It works by transferring knowledge from a higher-capacity teacher model to a lower-capacity student model. Most KD methods can be categorized by how they define the knowledge stored in the teacher (i.e., the \"soft targets\" of training as defined in existing literature). For instance, Hinton et al. (2014) originally proposed KD for neural networks, and they define the output class probabilities (i.e., soft labels) generated by the teacher as the targets for assisting the training of students. In a follow up work, Romero et al. (2015) defined the soft targets via the feature maps in the teacher model's hidden layers. To train a student network with KD effectively, it is important to distill as much knowledge from the teacher as possible. However, previous methods overlook the importance of the medium by which the teacher's knowledge is demonstrated: the training data points. We conjecture that there exist examples, not necessarily seen and ingested by the teacher, that might make it easier for the student to absorb the teacher's knowledge. Blindly adding more training examples may not be beneficial because it may slow down training and introduce unnecessary biases (Ho et al., 2019) . The analogy with how human teachers adjust their teaching to their students' particular situations (e.g., with the feedback gathered from the students during teaching) suggests that a reasonable yet uninvestigated approach might be to augment the training data for both the teacher and student according to distinct policies. In this paper, we study whether and how adaptive data augmentation and knowledge distillation can be leveraged synergistically to better train student networks. We propose a two-stage, rolewise data augmentation process for KD. This process consists of: (1) training a teacher network till convergence while learning a schedule of policies to augment the training data specifically for the teacher; (2) distilling the knowledge from the teacher into a student network while learning another schedule of policies to augment the training data specifically for the student. It is worth noting that this two-stage framework is orthogonal to existing methods for KD, which focus on how the knowledge to be distilled is defined; thus, our approach can be combined with previous methods straighforwardly. Although our proposed method can in principle be applied to any models trained via KD, we focus specifically on how to use it to transfer the knowledge from a full-precision teacher network into a student network with lower bit-width. Network quantization is crucial when deploying trained models on embedded devices, or in data centers to reduce energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) . KD-based quantization (Zhuang et al., 2018; Polino et al., 2018) jointly trains a full-precision model, which acts as the teacher, alongside a low-precision model, which acts as the student. Previous work has shown that distilling a full-precision teacher's knowledge into a low-precision student, followed by fine-tuning, incurs noticeable performance degradation, especially when the bit-widths are below four (Zhuang et al., 2018; Polino et al., 2018) . We show that it is advantageous to use adaptive data augmentation to generate more training data for the low-precision network based on its specific weaknesses. For example, low-precision networks may have difficulties learning rotationrelated patterns, 1 and the data augmentation agent should be aware of this and generate more such data points. One positive side-effect for demonstrating the effectiveness of our method is that the improvement brought by our proposed method is more significant compared to the experiments on all full-precision models.",

We argue that, rather than just being an optimization trick, the weight-sharing approach is induced by the relaxation of a structured hypothesis space, and introduces new algorithmic and theoretical challenges as well as applications beyond neural architecture search. Algorithmically, we show how the geometry of ERM for weight-sharing requires greater care when designing gradient- based minimization methods and apply tools from non-convex non-Euclidean optimization to give general-purpose algorithms that adapt to the underlying structure. We further analyze the learning-theoretic behavior of the bilevel optimization solved by practical weight-sharing methods. Next, using kernel configuration and NLP feature selection as case studies, we demonstrate how weight-sharing applies to the architecture search generalization of NAS and effectively optimizes the resulting bilevel objective. Finally, we use our optimization analysis to develop a simple exponentiated gradient method for NAS that aligns with the underlying optimization geometry and matches state-of-the-art approaches on CIFAR-10. Weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS) methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance while requiring computation training of just a single shared-weights network (Pham et al., 2018; Li and Talwalkar, 2019; . However, weight-sharing remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel perspective on weight-sharing NAS motivated by the key observation that these methods subsume the architecture hyperparameters as another set of learned parameters of the shared-weights network, in effect extending the hypothesis class. An important ramification of this insight is that weight-sharing is not NAS-specific and can be used to tune hyperparameters corresponding to parameterized feature maps of the input data. We refer this larger subset of hyperparameter optimization problems as architecture search, and we study the following two questions associated with weight-sharing applied to the architecture search problem: 1. How can we efficiently optimize the objective induced by applying weight sharing to architecture search, namely minimizing empirical risk in the joint space of model and architecture parameters? For large structured search spaces that preclude brute force search, a natural approach to architecture search with weight-sharing is to use gradient-based methods to minimize the empirical risk over a continuous relaxation of the discrete space . Although this has allowed NAS researchers to apply their preferred optimizers to determine architecture weights, it is far from clear that the success of established methods for unconstrained optimization in training neural networks will naturally extend to these constrained and often non-Euclidean environments. As we foresee that architecture search spaces will continue to become more complex and multi-faceted, we argue for and develop a more principled, geometry-aware formulation of the optimization problem. Drawing upon the mirror descent meta-algorithm (Beck and Teboulle, 2003) and successive convex approximation, we give non-asymptotic stationary-point convergence guarantees for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) objective associated with weight-sharing via algorithms that simultaneously connect to the underlying problem structure and handle the alternating-block nature of the architecture search. Our guarantees inform the design of gradient-based weight-sharing methods by explicitly quantifying the impact of optimizing in the right geometry on convergence rates. 2. What are the generalization benefits of solving a bilevel optimization for the architecture search problem commonly considered in practice? At its core, the goal of architecture search is to find a configuration that achieves good generalization performance. Consequently, a bilevel objective that optimizes the architecture weights using a separate validation loss is commonly used in practice in lieu of the ERM objective naturally induced by weight sharing (Pham et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019) . The learning aspects of this approach have generally been studied in settings with much stronger control over the model complexity (Kearns et al., 1997) . We provide generalization guarantees for this objective over structured hypothesis spaces associated with a finite set of architectures; this leads to meaningful bounds for simple feature map selection problems as well as insightful results for the NAS problem that depend on the size of the space of global optima. To validate our theoretical results, we conduct empirical studies of weight-sharing in two settings: (1) shallow feature map selection, i.e., tuning the hyperparameters of kernel classification and NLP featurization pipelines, and (2) CNN neural architecture search. In (1) we demonstrate that weightsharing efficiently optimizes the bilevel objective and achieves low generalization error with respect to the best architecture setting. For (2), motivated by insights from our convergence analysis, we develop a simple exponentiated gradient version of DARTS called EDARTS that better exploits the geometry of the optimization problem. We evaluate EDARTS on the design of CNN architectures for CIFAR-10 and demonstrate that EDARTS finds better architectures than DARTS in less than half the time. We also achieve very competitive results relative to state-of-the-art architectures when using an extended evaluation routine. Related Work: Our work on optimization for weight-sharing benefits from the literature on firstorder stochastic optimization (Hazan and Kale, 2014; Beck, 2017) and in particular the mirror descent framework (Beck and Teboulle, 2003) . Specifically, we use successive convex approximation (Razaviyayn et al., 2013; Mairal, 2015) to show convergence of alternating minimization and derive geometry-dependent rates comparable to existing work on non-convex stochastic mirror descent (Dang and Lan, 2015; Zhang and He, 2018) . Our result generalizes to the constrained, nonEuclidean, and multi-block setting an approach of Agarwal et al. (2019) for obtaining non-convex convergence from strongly convex minimization, which may be of independent interest. Previous optimization results for NAS have generally only shown bounds on auxiliary quantities such as regret that are not well-connected to the learning objective Carlucci et al., 2019) or have only given monotonic improvement or asymptotic guarantees (Akimoto et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2019) . However, due to the generality of mirror descent, the approaches in the middle three papers can be seen as special cases of our analysis. Finally, our analysis of the properties of the bilevel optimization is related to work on model selection (Vuong, 1989; Kearns et al., 1997) , but does not consider the configuration parameters as explicit controls on the model complexity. Our learning results are broadly related to hyperparameter optimization, although most work focuses on algorithmic and not statistical questions (Li et al., 2018; Kandasamy et al., 2017) .",

Negative transfer makes models perform poorly on new data. This paper proposes using \"adversarial training\" to prevent negative transfer. Adversarial training pits two models against each other - one trying to predict from relevant features, the other from irrelevant ones.

        "article": "An unintended consequence of feature sharing is the model fitting to correlated tasks within the dataset, termed negative transfer.   In this paper, we revisit the problem of negative transfer in multitask setting and find that its corrosive effects are applicable to a wide range of linear and non-linear models, including neural networks. We first study the effects of negative transfer in a principled way and show that previously proposed counter-measures are insufficient, particularly for trainable features. We propose an adversarial training approach to mitigate the effects of negative transfer by viewing the problem in a domain adaptation setting. Finally, empirical results on attribute prediction multi-task on AWA and CUB datasets further validate the need for correcting negative sharing in an end-to-end manner. Advances in machine learning have led to proficient supervised learning models with powerful representations in various prediction tasks. We now expect an ideal classification model to restrict itself to a pertinent set of evidences available to it from the input for prediction. Further, we expect the model to disregard any unrelated evidences in the data to enable better generalization. Figure 1: A supervised classifier 'cheetah vs. snow-leopard' that uses unrelated evidence (of habitat) over relevant evidence (of fur patterns). As shown by the pixel importance maps, the model suffers from the negative transfer prevalent in a typical animal image dataset skewed towards the animal's typical habitat and fails to generalize to rare samples.Let us consider the task of training an animal classifier \"cheetah vs. snow-leopards\" from a dataset of images of these animals, such as those illustrated in Figure 1 -a task which ideally should focus on the animal's appearance features. However, a large portion of these images also contain various cues of the typical habitat of the animals in the background, i.e., tall grass and snow (see Figures 1 (a) and (b)) which are, in principle, unrelated to the animal's appearance. An archetypal model is deceived by the co-occurrence of such unrelated, yet easily detectable cues of habitat over the animal's appearance features such as complex fur patterns. However, a proficient supervised learning model must identify relevant evidences for the label of interest and at the same time discard various unrelated evidences such as presence of snow, even though it tends to co-occur frequently with snow-leopard. Consequently, it would be more likely that such a model would perform better on rare-instances (such as those in Figures 1 (c) and (d)) and generalize better to unseen instances.This phenomenon of co-occurring but unrelated evidences being present in training data and thereby having a debilitating effect on model performance has been described in literature BID8 ; BID16 ; BID9 ; BID13 ; BID15 ). These techniques utilize the easy availability of labels for unrelated evidences (e.g. background habitat labels above), called negative labels which constitutes an auxiliary task, and seek to mitigate its debilitating performance on the primary task (e.g. animal classification above) with techniques referred to as negative-sharing or negative-transfer.While all of these techniques have tackled this problem utilizing various forms of regularization, we describe several shortcomings of this class of approaches, most notable of which is their inapplicability to the popular paradigm of trainable features obtained via neural representation learning. Motivated by these limitations, in this paper we depart from the direction of regularization-based approaches and examine methods inspired from a domain-adaptation viewpoint to propose an adversarial training-based formulation. We uniquely view such a scenario as an instance of adversarial multi-task learning, where the classification tasks are either the primary task of interest (i.e., predicting the presence of fur pattern and color) or the auxiliary negative tasks (i.e., characteristics of habitat) to be avoided. Since the 2 tasks are unrelated, any label correlation between primary and auxiliary labels in the training data is only by chance and therefore from a domain-adaptation perspective, we envision a target-domain as possibly having a different correlation between the primary and auxiliary labels. The effects of negative transfer are hence mitigated when the classification task is trained in this domain.We discuss advantages of our proposed formulation, inspired from domain-adaptation, to alleviate the negative transfer over existing techniques, including ready applicability to neural networks in an end-to-end fashion. It must be noted that, while the formulation of the problem is motivated with multi-task learning, negative-transfer is a disposition of any supervised learning task from simple binary classification to recent popular supervised tasks such as image detection, captioning, or visual dialog. We present motivating literature that prelude this work next. In this work, we show that adversarial learning is the natural answer to prevent negative transfer. This leads to potential improvement in any supervised learning of natural data that is seeking generalization. We find that even in relatively straight-forward linear models presented above, co-occurrence of unrelated labels hampers performance and must be explicitly treated. We address the problem of negative transfer in a multi-task scenario, and also show the applicability of our solution in any supervised task. Supervised learning practitioners can utilize domain expertise to acquire and leverage additional negative labels for this purpose. Recent work in explainability of machine learning models can also be appropriately leveraged to facilitate this task.",

        "article": "Dropout is a simple yet effective technique to improve generalization performance and prevent overfitting in deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we discuss three novel observations about dropout to better understand the generalization of DNNs with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations: 1) dropout is a smoothing technique that encourages each local linear model of a DNN to be trained on data points from nearby regions; 2) a constant dropout rate can result in effective neural-deactivation rates that are significantly different for layers with different fractions of activated neurons; and 3) the rescaling factor of dropout causes an inconsistency to occur between the normalization during training and testing conditions when batch normalization is also used.   The above leads to three simple but nontrivial improvements to dropout resulting in our proposed method \"Jumpout. \" Jumpout samples the dropout rate using a monotone decreasing distribution (such as the right part of a truncated Gaussian), so the local linear model at each data point is trained, with high probability, to work better for data points from nearby than from more distant regions. Instead of tuning a dropout rate for each layer and applying it to all samples, jumpout moreover adaptively normalizes the dropout rate at each layer and every training sample/batch, so the effective dropout rate applied to the activated neurons are kept the same. Moreover, we rescale the outputs of jumpout for a better trade-off that keeps both the variance and mean of neurons more consistent between training and test phases, which mitigates the incompatibility between dropout and batch normalization. Compared to the original dropout, jumpout shows significantly improved performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Fashion- MNIST, STL10, SVHN, ImageNet-1k, etc., while introducing negligible additional memory and computation costs. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success on a variety of machine learning tasks BID15 BID14 . Deep neural networks (DNN), however, are often able to fit the training data perfectly -this can result in the overfitting problem, thereby weakening the generalization performance on unseen data. Dropout BID17 BID7 is a simple yet effective technique to mitigate such problems by randomly setting the activations of hidden neurons to 0, a strategy that reduces co-adaptation amongst neurons. Dropout applies to any layer in a DNN without causing significant additional computational overhead.Dropout, however, has several drawbacks. Firstly, dropout rates, constituting extra hyper-parameters at each layer, need to be tuned to get optimal performance. Too high a dropout rate can slow the convergence rate of the model, and often hurt final performance. Too low a rate yields few or no improvements on generalization performance. Ideally, dropout rates should be tuned separately for each layer and also during various training stages. In practice, to reduce computation, we often tune a single dropout rate and keep it constant for all dropout layers and throughout the training process.If we treat dropout as a type of perturbation on each training sample, it acts to generalize the DNN to noisy samples having that specific expected amount of perturbation (due to the fixed dropout rate) with high probability. The fixed rate rules out samples typical having less perturbation, i.e., those potentially more likely to be closer to the original samples and thus that are potentially more helpful to improve generalization. Also, when a constant dropout rate is applied to layers and samples having different fractions of activated neurons, the effective dropout rate (i.e., the proportion of the activated neurons that are deactivated by dropout) varies, which might result in too much perturbation for some layers and samples and too little perturbation for others.Another deficiency of dropout lies in its incompatibility with batch normalization (BN) BID8 (more empirical evidence of this is shown in Section 3.3). As dropout randomly shuts down activated neurons, it needs to rescale the undropped neurons to match the original overall activation gain of the layer. Unfortunately, such rescaling breaks the consistency of the normalization parameters required between training and test phases 1 and may cause poor behavior when used with BN. Since BN, and its variants BID0 BID18 BID20 , has become an almost indispensable component of modern DNN architectures to keep the training stable and to accelerate convergence, dropout itself often gets dropped out in the choice between these two non-complementary options and has recently become less popular.",

A major challenge in RL is solving tasks that require planning over long time periods with infrequent rewards, like navigating a maze. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) tries to solve this by breaking down the task into multiple levels of abstraction. \n\nThis paper proposes a new HRL approach called Hierarchical Decompositional Reinforcement Learning (HiDe). HiDe has three levels: a planning layer that learns the overall path, a middle layer that refines the plan into shorter goals, and a low-level layer that controls the agent's movements. The layers are trained together but separated by their functions.\n\nThe planning layer creates a value map of the environment and uses an attention network to estimate how far the agent can move in one step. It then chooses a subgoal location that maximizes the value while staying within the movable range. The middle layer turns this subgoal into a series of shorter-term targets. The low layer executes actions to reach each target.\n\nHiDe was evaluated in 3D maze environments with sparse rewards given only for reaching the goal. Even when trained with a fixed start and end point, HiDe could generalize to random maze configurations it had never seen before. Impressively, the planning layer could also be transferred between different agents, like controlling a ball versus a humanoid character.\n\nThis functional decomposition and ability to generalize across environments shows the potential of HRL methods like HiDe for solving complex decision-making tasks.

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has held the promise to enhance the capabilities of RL agents via operation on different levels of temporal abstraction. Despite the success of recent works in dealing with inherent nonstationarity and sample complexity, it remains difficult to generalize to unseen environments and to transfer different layers of the policy to other agents. In this paper, we propose a novel HRL architecture, Hierarchical Decompositional Reinforcement Learning (HiDe), which allows decomposition of the hierarchical layers into independent subtasks, yet allows for joint training of all layers in end-to-end manner. The main insight is to combine a control policy on a lower level with an image-based planning policy on a higher level. We evaluate our method on various complex continuous control tasks for navigation, demonstrating that generalization across environments and transfer of higher level policies can be achieved. See videos https://sites.google.com/view/hide-rl Reinforcement learning (RL) has been succesfully applied to sequential-decision making tasks, such as learning how to play video games in Atari (Mnih et al., 2013) , mastering the game of Go or continuous control in robotics (Lillicrap et al., 2015; Levine et al., 2015; . However, despite the success of RL agents in learning control policies for myopic tasks, such as reaching a nearby target, they lack the ability to effectively reason over extended horizons. In this paper, we consider continuous control tasks that require planning over long horizons in navigation environments with sparse rewards. The task becomes particularly challenging with sparse and delayed rewards since an agent needs to infer which actions caused the reward in a domain where most samples give no signal at all. Common techniques to mitigate the issue of sparse rewards include learning from demonstrations (Schaal, 1999; Peng et al., 2018) or using enhanced exploration strategies (Bellemare et al., 2016; Pathak et al., 2017; Andrychowicz et al., 2017) . Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has been proposed in part to solve such tasks. Typically, a sequential decision making task is split into several simpler subtasks of different temporal and functional abstraction levels (Sutton et al., 1999; Andre & Russell, 2002) . Although the hierarchies would ideally be learned in parallel, most methods resort to curriculum learning (Frans et al., 2017; Florensa et al., 2017; Bacon et al., 2016; Vezhnevets et al., 2017) . Recent goal-conditioned hierarchical architectures have successfully trained policies jointly via off-policy learning (Levy et al., 2019; Nachum et al., 2018; . However, these methods often do not generalize to unseen environments as we show in Section 5.1. We argue that this is due to a lack of true separation of planning and low-level control across the hierarchy. In this paper, we consider two main problems, namely functional decomposition of HRL architectures in navigation-based domains and generalization of RL agents to unseen environments (figure 1). To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-level HRL architecture that enables both functional decomposition and temporal abstraction. We introduce a 3-level hierarchy that decouples the major roles in a complex navigation task, namely planning and low-level control. The benefit of a modular design is twofold. First, layers have access to only task-relevant information for a predefined task, which significantly improves the generalization ability of the overall policy. Hence, this enables policies learned on a single task to solve randomly configured environments. Second, Figure 1 : Navigation environments. The red sphere indicates the goal an agent needs to reach, with the starting point at the opposite end of the maze. The agent is trained on environment a). To test generalization, we use the environments with b) reversed starting and goal positions, c) mirrored maze with reversed starting and goal positions and d) randomly generated mazes. the planning and control layers are modular and thus allow for composition of cross-agent architectures. We empirically show that the planning layer of the hierarchy can be transferred successfully to new agents. During training we provide global environment information only to the planning layer, whereas the full internal state of the agent is only accessible by the control layer. The actions of the top and middle layers are in the form of displacement in space. Similarly, the goals of the middle and lowest layers are relative to the current position. This prevents the policies from overfitting to the global position in an environment and hence encourages generalization to new environments. In our framework (see figure 2), the planner (i.e., the highest level policy \u03c0 2 ) learns to find a trajectory leading the agent to the goal. Specifically, we learn a value map of the environment by means of a value propagation network (Nardelli et al., 2019) . To prevent the policy from issuing too ambitious subgoals, an attention network estimates the range of the lower level policy \u03c0 0 (i.e., the agent). This attention mask also ensures that the planning considers the agent performance. The action of \u03c0 2 is the position which maximizes the masked value map, which serves as goal input to the policy \u03c0 1 . The middle layer implements an interface between the upper planner and lower control layer, which refines the coarser subgoals into shorter and reachable targets for the agent. The middle layer is crucial in functionally decoupling the abstract task of planning (\u03c0 2 ) from agent specific continuous control. The lowest layer learns a control policy \u03c0 0 to steer the agent to intermediate goals. While the policies are functionally decoupled, they are trained together and must learn to cooperate. In this work, we focus on solving long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards in complex continuous navigation domains. We first show in a maze environment that generalization causes challenges for state-of-the-art approaches. We then demonstrate that training with the same environment configuration (i.e., fixed start and goal positions) can generalize to randomly configured environments. Lastly, we show the benefits of functional decomposition via transfer of individual layers between different agents. In particular, we train our method with a simple 2DoF ball agent in a maze environment to learn the planning layer which is later used to steer a more complex agent. The results indicate that the proposed decomposition of policy layers is effective and can generalize to unseen environments. In summary our main contributions include: \u2022 A novel multi-layer HRL architecture that allows functional decomposition and temporal abstraction for navigation tasks. \u2022 This architecture enables generalization beyond training conditions and environments. \u2022 Functional decomposition that allows transfer of individual layers across different agents. In this paper, we introduce a novel HRL architecture that can solve complex navigation tasks in 3D-based maze environments. The architecture consists of a planning layer which learns an explicit value map and is connected with a subgoal refinement layer and a low-level control layer. The framework can be trained end-to-end. While training with a fixed starting and goal position, our method is able to generalize to previously unseen settings and environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transfer of planners between different agents can be achieved, enabling us to transfer a planner trained with a simplistic agent such as a ball to a more complex agent such as an ant or humanoid. In future work, we want to consider integration of a more general planner that is not restricted to navigation-based environments.",

        "claude": "Neural networks and machine learning models are trained on data to be able to make predictions or classifications. A common way to train them is using an approach called cross-entropy loss minimization. This research shows that when training linear classifiers (simple machine learning models) on data that lies in a low-dimensional space using cross-entropy loss, the decision boundary learned can end up being very close to the training data points. \n\nThis is an issue because it means the model has a small margin of error - it can misclassify data points that are only slightly different from the training data. This vulnerability to small perturbations is related to the phenomenon of \"adversarial examples\" where machine learning models fail on inputs that seem identical to humans.\n\nThe researchers propose an alternative training method called \"differential training\" that aims to maximize the margin or distance between the decision boundary and data points of different classes. They prove that differential training achieves the maximum possible margin for linear classifiers.\n\nIncreasing the margin could make models more robust to adversarial attacks and perturbations in the data. The low dimensionality of data is identified as one root cause for why cross-entropy training yields small margins. The researchers suggest differential training may help neural networks also become more robust against adversarial examples.\n\nOverall, this work analyzes an important issue in machine learning, proposes a new training approach, and provides insights into factors like low dimensionality that affect model robustness and generalization.\n",
        "cohere": "Neural networks, powerful tools used for classification tasks, sometimes struggle with inputs that are only slightly different from their training data. This issue, known as adversarial examples, indicates that the network's decision boundaries are too close to the training data. In a recent study, researchers focused on binary classification and found that even linear classifiers can suffer from this problem when trained with the commonly used cross-entropy loss function. They introduced a new training method called differential training, which defines a loss function on pairs of points from different classes, pushing the decision boundary further away from the training data and improving the network's robustness. Interestingly, they also found that the dimensionality of the training data plays a role, with low-dimensional data being more susceptible to small margins between decision boundaries and data points. The findings suggest that the choice of loss function and training algorithm are critical factors in the network's performance and robustness, providing valuable insights for improving the resilience of neural networks against adversarial examples.

        "article": "Neural networks could misclassify inputs that are slightly different from their training data, which indicates a small margin between their decision boundaries and the training dataset. In this work, we study the binary classification of linearly separable datasets and show that linear classifiers could also have decision boundaries that lie close to their training dataset if cross-entropy loss is used for training. In particular, we show that if the features of the training dataset lie in a low-dimensional affine subspace and the cross-entropy loss is minimized by using a gradient method, the margin between the training points and the decision boundary could be much smaller than the optimal value. This result is contrary to the conclusions of recent related works such as (Soudry et al., 2018), and we identify the reason for this contradiction. In order to improve the margin, we introduce differential training, which is a training paradigm that uses a loss function defined on pairs of points from each class. We show that the decision boundary of a linear classifier trained with differential training indeed achieves the maximum margin. The results reveal the use of cross-entropy loss as one of the hidden culprits of adversarial examples and introduces a new direction to make neural networks robust against them. Training neural networks is challenging and involves making several design choices. Among these are the architecture of the network, the training loss function, the optimization algorithm used for training, and their hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the batch size. Most of these design choices influence the solution obtained by the training procedure and have been studied in detail BID9 BID4 BID5 Wilson et al., 2017; BID17 BID19 . Nevertheless, one choice has been mostly taken for granted when the network is trained for a classification task: the training loss function.Cross-entropy loss function is almost the sole choice for classification tasks in practice. Its prevalent use is backed theoretically by its association with the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical distribution of a dataset and the confidence of the classifier for that dataset. Given the particular success of neural networks for classification tasks BID11 BID18 BID5 , there seems to be little motivation to search for alternatives for this loss function, and most of the software developed for neural networks incorporates an efficient implementation for it, thereby facilitating its use.Recently there has been a line of work analyzing the dynamics of training a linear classifier with the cross-entropy loss function BID15 b; BID7 . They specified the decision boundary that the gradient descent algorithm yields on linearly separable datasets and claimed that this solution achieves the maximum margin.1 However, these claims were observed not to hold in the simple experiments we ran. For example, FIG6 displays a case where the cross-entropy minimization for a linear classifier leads to a decision boundary which attains an extremely poor margin and is nearly orthogonal to the solution given by the hard-margin support vector machine (SVM).We set out to understand this discrepancy between the claims of the previous works and our observations on the simple experiments. We can summarize our contributions as follows. We compare our results with related works and discuss their implications for the following subjects.Adversarial examples. State-of-the-art neural networks have been observed to misclassify inputs that are slightly different from their training data, which indicates a small margin between their decision boundaries and the training dataset (Szegedy et al., 2013; BID3 MoosaviDezfooli et al., 2017; . Our results reveal that the combination of gradient methods, cross-entropy loss function and the low-dimensionality of the training dataset (at least in some domain) has a responsibility for this problem. Note that SVM with the radial basis function was shown to be robust against adversarial examples, and this was attributed to the high nonlinearity of the radial basis function in BID3 . Given that the SVM uses neither the cross entropy loss function nor the gradient descent algorithm for training, we argue that the robustness of SVM is no surprise -independent of its nonlinearity. Lastly, effectiveness of differential training for neural networks against adversarial examples is our ongoing work. The activations feeding into the soft-max layer could be considered as the features for a linear classifier. Plot shows the cumulative variance explained for these features as a function of the number of principle components used. Almost all the variance in the features is captured by the first 20 principle components out of 84, which shows that the input to the soft-max layer resides predominantly in a low-dimensional subspace.Low-dimensionality of the training dataset. As stated in Remark 3, as the dimension of the affine subspace containing the training dataset gets very small compared to the dimension of the input space, the training algorithm will become more likely to yield a small margin for the classifier. This observation confirms the results of BID13 , which showed that if the set of training data is projected onto a low-dimensional subspace before feeding into a neural network, the performance of the network against adversarial examples is improved -since projecting the inputs onto a low-dimensional domain corresponds to decreasing the dimension of the input space. Even though this method is effective, it requires the knowledge of the domain in which the training points are low-dimensional. Because this knowledge will not always be available, finding alternative training algorithms and loss functions that are suited for low-dimensional data is still an important direction for future research.Robust optimization. Using robust optimization techniques to train neural networks has been shown to be effective against adversarial examples BID12 BID0 . Note that these techniques could be considered as inflating the training points by a presumed amount and training the classifier with these inflated points. Consequently, as long as the cross-entropy loss is involved, the decision boundaries of the neural network will still be in the vicinity of the inflated points. Therefore, even though the classifier is robust against the disturbances of the presumed magnitude, the margin of the classifier could still be much smaller than what it could potentially be.Differential training. We introduced differential training, which allows the feature mapping to remain trainable while ensuring a large margin between different classes of points. Therefore, this method combines the benefits of neural networks with those of support vector machines. Even though moving from 2N training points to N 2 seems prohibitive, it points out that a true classification should in fact be able to differentiate between the pairs that are hardest to differentiate, and this search will necessarily require an N 2 term. Some heuristic methods are likely to be effective, such as considering only a smaller subset of points closer to the boundary and updating this set of points as needed during training. If a neural network is trained with this procedure, the network will be forced to find features that are able to tell apart between the hardest pairs.Nonseparable data. What happens when the training data is not linearly separable is an open direction for future work. However, as stated in Remark 4, this case is not expected to arise for the state-of-the-art networks, since they have been shown to achieve zero training error even on randomly generated datasets (Zhang et al., 2017) , which implies that the features represented by the output of their penultimate layer eventually become linearly separable. A PROOF OF THEOREM 1Theorem 1 could be proved by using Theorem 2, but we provide an independent proof here.

Remember tha\u1e6b DISPLAYFORM10 We can compute f (w) = 2acw + bcw 2 + ab b 2 w 2 + 2abw + a 2 . The function f is strictly increasing and convex for w > 0. We have DISPLAYFORM11 Therefore, when b \u2265 a, the only fixed point of f over [0, \u221e) is the origin, and when a > b, 0 and (a \u2212 b)/(c \u2212 b) are the only fixed points of f over [0, \u221e). Figure 4 shows the curves over whichu = 0 and\u1e87 = 0. Since lim t\u2192\u221e u = lim t\u2192\u221e w, the only points (u, w) can converge to are the fixed points of f . Remember tha\u1e6b DISPLAYFORM12 so when a > b, the origin (0, 0) is unstable in the sense of Lyapunov, and (u, w) cannot converge to it. Otherwise, (0, 0) is the only fixed point, and it is stable.

        "article": "Training agents to operate in one environment often yields overfitted models that are unable to generalize to the changes in that environment. However, due to the numerous variations that can occur in the real-world, the agent is often required to be robust in order to be useful. This has not been the case for agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the overfitting of RL agents to the training environments in visual navigation tasks. Our experiments show that deep RL agents can overfit even when trained on multiple environments simultaneously. \n We propose a regularization method which combines RL with supervised learning methods by adding a term to the RL objective that would encourage the invariance of a policy to variations in the observations that ought not to affect the action taken. The results of this method, called invariance regularization, show an improvement in the generalization of policies to environments not seen during training.\n Learning control policies from high-dimensional sensory input has been gaining more traction lately due to the popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) Mnih et al. (2015) ; ; Zhang et al. (2018b) ; Rakelly et al. (2019) , which enables learning the perception and control modules simultaneously. However, most of the work done in RL chooses to evaluate the learned policies in the same environment in which training occurred Cobbe et al. (2018) . Using the same environments to train and test agents does not give any insight into the generalization abilities of the learned policy. There could be a number of changes in the environment at test time that would degrade the agent's performance. Variations could appear in the visual aspects that determine the agent's observation, the physical structure that determines the agent's state and even some aspects that are related to the agent's goal (Figure 1 ). For example, different observations of the same room are encountered at different times of the day (different lighting conditions). New obstacles could be present. Levels of a game could be different, yet playing a few levels should often be enough to figure out how to play the rest. Such variations might result in a new environment where the control model that defined the training environment has changed. A robust policy should generalize from its experience and perform the same skills in the presence of these variations. DRL agents have been notorious for overfitting to their training environments Cobbe et al. (2018) . An agent could have drastically different performance on testing environments even if it manages to maximize the reward during training Zhang et al. (2018a) . Supervised learning algorithms have been shown to have some generalization guarantees when adding proper regularization Mohri et al. (2018) . However, these guarantees are weakened in reinforcement learning algorithms where the source of the data is not i.i.d.. In order to make use of the progress of DRL algorithms in practice we need policies that are robust to possible changes in the sensory inputs, surrounding structure and even some aspects of the task. In this paper we study the notion of generalization that is appropriate for visual navigation control policies that are learned with DRL. We present: (1) a study of the generalization of visual control policies to certain changes in the underlying dynamical system; (2) an alternative training method that combines DRL with supervised learning, thus using DRL to learn a controller while leveraging the generalization properties of supervised learning. In our experiments we use the VizDoom platform Kempka et al. (2016) which is easily customizable and enables the generation of numerous variants of a given environment. We present a study of the generalization capabilities of visual navigation agents trained with deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We formalize what it means to generalize in the context of a POMDP. We find that the tendency of RL agent to overfit even when exposed to large training sets is quite visible. We show that using domain randomization with RL, without adding invariant features to the input such as the depth maps, is not enough to generalize. In the second part, we proposed Invariance Regularization (IR), a method that attempts to regularize the RL model with a supervised learning loss. It improves the generalization success and displays stable performance across different seeds. In this work, we focused our experimentation on generalization to changes in the input observation. However, it is also interesting to generalize the learned skills to different architectural designs of the environment, just as one one wishes to generalize to different levels of the game as proposed in the retro competition Nichol et al. (2018) . Another avenue of future work is to explore the appropriate transformation function T of the observations.One might consider an adaptive form of T learned with data augmentation Cubuk et al. (2018) or adversarial examples Goodfellow et al. (2015 The first part consists of training RL on the observations of the original training environment, while the second part can be seen as a supervised learning objective on the transformed observations, as shown in Algorithm 1. The first step trains RL on one environment and then use the actions that the trained policy would have taken in that environment to tune the model with supervised learning on the textured environments. In the reported experiments using the split version, the model is trained with one iteration of the algorithm. Therefore, the training process has two stages, train RL then train with a supervised learning setup, without iterating between both.",

        "article": "Unsupervised embedding learning aims to extract good representations from data without the use of human-annotated labels. Such techniques are apparently in the limelight because of the challenges in collecting massive-scale labels required for supervised learning. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach, called Super-AND, which is based on the Anchor Neighbourhood Discovery model. Multiple losses defined in Super-AND make similar samples gather even within a low-density space and keep features invariant against augmentation. As a result, our model outperforms existing approaches in various benchmark datasets and achieves an accuracy of 89.2% in CIFAR-10 with the Resnet18 backbone network, a 2.9% gain over the state-of-the-art. Deep learning and convolutional neural network have become an indispensable technique in computer vision (LeCun et al., 2015; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 1997) . Remarkable developments, in particular, were led by supervised learning that requires thousands or more labeled data. However, high annotation costs have become a significant drawback in training a scalable and practical model in many domains. In contrast, unsupervised deep learning that requires no label has recently started to get attention in computer vision tasks. From clustering analysis (Caron et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2018) , and self-supervised model (Gidaris et al., 2018; Bojanowski & Joulin, 2017) to generative model (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2013; Radford et al., 2016) , various learning methods came out and showed possibilities and prospects. Unsupervised embedding learning aims to extract visually meaningful representations without any label information. Here \"visually meaningful\" refers to finding features that satisfy two traits: (i) positive attention and (ii) negative separation (Ye et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017c; Oh Song et al., 2016) . Data samples from the same ground truth class, i.e., positive samples, should be close in the embedding space (Fig. 1a) ; whereas those from different classes, i.e., negative samples, should be pushed far away in the embedding space (Fig. 1b) . However, in the setting of unsupervised learning, a model cannot have knowledge about whether given data points are positive samples or negative samples. Several new methods have been proposed to find 'visually meaningful' representations. The sample specificity method considers all data points as negative samples and separates them in the feature space (Wu et al., 2018; Bojanowski & Joulin, 2017) . Although this method achieves high performance, its decisions are known to be biased from learning only from negative separation. One approach utilizes data augmentation to consider positive samples in training (Ye et al., 2019) , which efficiently reduces any ambiguity in supervision while keeping invariant features in the embedding space. Another approach is called the Anchor Neighborhood Discovery (AND) model, which alleviates the complexity in boundaries by discovering the nearest neighbor among the data points (Huang et al., 2019) . Each of these approaches overcomes different limitations of the sample specificity method. However, no unified approach has been proposed. This paper presents a holistic method for unsupervised embedding learning, named Super-AND. Super-AND extends the AND algorithm and unifies various but dominant approaches in this domain with its unique architecture. Our proposed model not only focuses on learning distinctive features across neighborhoods, but also emphasizes edge information in embeddings and maintains the unchanging class information from the augmented data. Besides combining existing techniques, we newly introduce Unification Entropy loss (UE-loss), an adversary of sample specificity loss, which is able to gather similar data points within a low-density space. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets to verify the superiority of the model. The results show the synergetic advantages among modules of Super-AND. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: \u2022 We effectively unify various techniques from state-of-the-art models and introduce a new loss, UE-loss, to make similar data samples gather in the low-density space. \u2022 Super-AND outperforms all baselines in various benchmark datasets. It achieved an accuracy of 89.2% in the CIFAR-10 dataset with the ResNet18 backbone network, compared to the state-of-the-art that gained 86.3%. \u2022 The extensive experiments and the ablation study show that every component in Super-AND contributes to the performance increase, and also indicate their synergies are critical. Our model's outstanding performance is a step closer to the broader adoption of unsupervised techniques in computer vision tasks. The premise of data-less embedding learning is at its applicability to practical scenarios, where there exists only one or two examples per cluster. Codes and trained data for Super-AND are accessible via a GitHub link. Generative model. This type of model is a powerful branch in unsupervised learning. By reconstructing the underlying data distribution, a model can generate new data points as well as features from images without labels. Generative adversarial network (Goodfellow et al., 2014) has led to rapid progress in image generation problems Arjovsky et al., 2017) . While some attempts have been made in terms of unsupervised embedding learning (Radford et al., 2016) , the main objective of generative models lies at mimicking the true distribution of each class, rather than discovering distinctive categorical information the data contains. Self-supervised learning. This type of learning uses inherent structures in images as pseudo-labels and exploits labels for back-propagation. For example, a model can be trained to create embeddings by predicting the relative position of a pixel from other pixels (Doersch et al., 2015) or the degree of changes after rotating images (Gidaris et al., 2018) . Predicting future frames of a video can benefit from this technique (Walker et al., 2016) . Wu et al. (2018) proposed the sample specificity method that learns feature representation from capturing apparent discriminability among instances. All of these methods are suitable for unsupervised embedding learning, although there exists a risk of false knowledge from generated labels that weakly correlate with the underlying class information. Learning invariants from augmentation. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables a model to learn from datasets with an increased variety of instances. Popular techniques include flipping, scaling, rotation, and grey-scaling. These techniques do not deform any crucial features of data, but only change the style of images. Some studies hence use augmentation techniques and train models Clustering analysis. This type of analysis is an extensively studied area in unsupervised learning, whose main objective is to group similar objects into the same class. Many studies either leveraged deep learning for dimensionality reduction before clustering (Schroff et al., 2015; Baldi, 2012) or trained models in an end-to-end fashion (Xie et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016) . Caron et al. (2018) proposed a concept called deep cluster, an iterative method that updates its weights by predicting cluster assignments as pseudo-labels. However, directly reasoning the global structures without any label is error-prone. The AND model, which we extend in this work, combines the advantages of sample specificity and clustering strategy to mitigate the noisy supervision via neighborhood analysis (Huang et al., 2019) . This paper presents Super-AND, a holistic technique for unsupervised embedding learning. Besides the synergetic advantage combining existing methods brings, the newly proposed UE-loss that groups nearby data points even in a low-density space while maintaining invariant features via data augmentation. The experiments with both coarse-grained and fine-grained datasets demonstrate our model's outstanding performance against the state-of-the-art models. Our efforts to advance unsupervised embedding learning directly benefit future applications that rely on various image clustering tasks. The high accuracy achieved by Super-AND makes the unsupervised learning approach an economically viable option where labels are costly to generate.",

        "article": "Spectral clustering is a leading and popular technique in unsupervised data analysis.   Two of its major limitations are scalability and generalization of the spectral embedding (i.e., out-of-sample-extension). In this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to spectral clustering that overcomes the above shortcomings. Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which are implemented using a special purpose output layer, allow us to keep the network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.   Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of  SpectralNet.   State-of-the-art clustering results are reported for both the MNIST and Reuters datasets.\n Discovering clusters in unlabeled data is a task of significant scientific and practical value. With technological progress images, texts, and other types of data are acquired in large numbers. Their labeling, however, is often expensive, tedious, or requires expert knowledge. Clustering techniques provide useful tools to analyze such data and to reveal its underlying structure.Spectral Clustering BID20 BID16 BID22 ) is a leading and highly popular clustering algorithm. It works by embedding the data in the eigenspace of the Laplacian matrix, derived from the pairwise similarities between data points, and applying k-means to this representation to obtain the clusters. Several properties make spectral clustering appealing: First, its embedding optimizes a natural cost function, minimizing pairwise distances between similar data points; moreover, this optimal embedding can be found analytically. Second, spectral clustering variants arise as relaxations of graph balanced-cut problems BID22 . Third, spectral clustering was shown to outperform other popular clustering algorithms such as k-means DCN, VaDE, DEPICT and IMSAT (bottom) on simulated datasets in 2D and 3D. Our approach successfully finds these non-convex clusters, whereas the competing algorithms fail on all five examples. (The full set of results for these algorithms is shown in FIG4 in Appendix A.) BID22 , arguably due to its ability to handle non-convex clusters. Finally, it has a solid probabilistic interpretation, since the Euclidean distance in the embedding space is equal to a diffusion distance, which, informally, measures the time it takes probability mass to transfer between points, via all the other points in the dataset BID15 BID5 .While spectral embedding of data points can be achieved by a simple eigen-decomposition of their graph Laplacian matrix, with large datasets direct computation of eigenvectors may be prohibitive. Moreover , generalizing a spectral embedding to unseen data points, a task commonly referred to as out-of-sample-extension (OOSE), is a non-trivial task; see, for example, BID1 BID2 BID9 BID6 ).In this work we introduce SpectralNet, a deep learning approach to spectral clustering, which addresses the scalability and OOSE problems pointed above. Specifically , SpectralNet is trained in a stochastic fashion, which allows it to scale. Moreover, once trained, it provides a function, implemented as a feed-forward network, that maps each input data point to its spectral embedding coordinates. This map can easily be applied to new test data. Unlike optimization of standard deep learning models, SpectralNet is trained using constrained optimization, where the constraint (orthogonality of the net outputs) is enforced by adding a linear layer, whose weights are set by the QR decomposition of its inputs. In addition, as good affinity functions are crucial for the success of spectral clustering, rather than using the common Euclidean distance to compute Gaussian affinity, we show how Siamese networks can be trained from the given unlabeled data to learn more informative pairwise distances and consequently significantly improve the quality of the clustering. Further improvement can be achieved if our network is applied to transformed data obtained by an autoencoder (AE). On the theoretical front, we utilize VC-dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of neural networks that compute spectral clustering. Our experiments indicate that our network indeed approximates the Laplacian eigenvectors well, allowing the network to cluster challenging non-convex point sets, which recent deep network based methods fail to handle; see examples in Figure 1. Finally, SpetralNet achieves competitive performance on MNIST handwritten digit dataset and state-of-the-art on the Reuters document dataset, whose size makes standard spectral clustering inapplicable. We have introduced SpectralNet, a deep learning approach for approximate spectral clustering. The stochastic training of SpectralNet allows us to scale to larger datasets than what vanilla spectral clustering can handle, and the parametric map obtained from the net enables straightforward out of sample extension. In addition, we propose to use unsupervised Siamese networks to compute distances, and empirically show that this results in better performance, comparing to standard Euclidean distances. Further improvement are achieved by applying our network to code representations produced with a standard stacked autoencoder. We present a novel analysis of the VC dimension of spectral clustering, and derive a lower bound on the size of neural nets that compute it. In addition, we report state of the art results on two benchmark datasets, and show that SpectralNet outperforms existing methods when the clusters cannot be contained in non overlapping convex shapes. We believe the integration of spectral clustering with deep learning provides a useful tool for unsupervised deep learning.",

        "article": "Convolutional networks are not aware of an object's geometric variations, which leads to inefficient utilization of model and data capacity. To overcome this issue, recent works on deformation modeling seek to spatially reconfigure the data towards a common arrangement such that semantic recognition suffers less from deformation. This is typically done by augmenting static operators with learned free-form sampling grids in the image space, dynamically tuned to the data and task for adapting the receptive field. Yet adapting the receptive field does not quite reach the actual goal -- what really matters to the network is the *effective* receptive field (ERF), which reflects how much each pixel contributes. It is thus natural to design other approaches to adapt the ERF directly during runtime. In this work, we instantiate one possible solution as Deformable Kernels (DKs), a family of novel and generic convolutional operators for handling object deformations by directly adapting the ERF while leaving the receptive field untouched. At the heart of our method is the ability to resample the original kernel space towards recovering the deformation of objects. This approach is justified with theoretical insights that the ERF is strictly determined by data sampling locations and kernel values. We implement DKs as generic drop-in replacements of rigid kernels and conduct a series of empirical studies whose results conform with our theories. Over several tasks and standard base models, our approach compares favorably against prior works that adapt during runtime. In addition, further experiments suggest a working mechanism orthogonal and complementary to previous works. The rich diversity of object appearance in images arises from variations in object semantics and deformation. Semantics describe the high-level abstraction of what we perceive, and deformation defines the geometric transformation tied to specific data (Gibson, 1950) . Humans are remarkably adept at making abstractions of the world (Hudson & Manning, 2019) ; we see in raw visual signals, abstract semantics away from deformation, and form concepts. Interestingly, modern convolutional networks follow an analogous process by making abstractions through local connectivity and weight sharing (Zhang, 2019) . However, such a mechanism is an inefficient one, as the emergent representations encode semantics and deformation together, instead of as disjoint notions. Though a convolution responds accordingly to each input, how it responds is primarily programmed by its rigid kernels, as in Figure 1(a, b) . In effect, this consumes large model capacity and data modes . We argue that the awareness of deformations emerges from adaptivity -the ability to adapt at runtime (Kanazawa et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019) . Modeling of geometric transformations has been a constant pursuit for vision researchers over decades (Lowe et al., 1999; Lazebnik et al., 2006; Jaderberg et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2017) . A basic idea is to spatially recompose data towards a common mode such that semantic recognition suffers less from deformation. A recent work that is representative of this direction is Deformable Convolution (Dai et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2019) . As shown in Figure 1 (c), it augments the convolutions with free-form sampling grids in the data space. It is previously justified as adapting receptive field, or what we phrase as the \"theoretical receptive field\", that defines which input pixels can contribute to the final output. However, theoretical receptive field does not measure how much impact an input pixel actually has. On the other hand, (Dai et al., 2017) reconfigure data towards common arrangement to counter the effects of geometric deformation. (d) Our Deformable Kernels (DKs) instead resample kernels and, in effect, adapt kernel spaces while leaving the data untouched. Note that (b) and (c) share kernel values but sample different data locations, while (b) and (d) share data locations but sample different kernel values. Luo et al. (2016) propose to measure the effective receptive field (ERF), i.e. the partial derivative of the output with respect to the input data, to quantify the exact contribution of each raw pixel to the convolution. Since adapting the theoretical receptive field is not the goal but a means to adapt the ERF, why not directly tune the ERF to specific data and tasks at runtime? Toward this end, we introduce Deformable Kernels (DKs), a family of novel and generic convolutional operators for deformation modeling. We aim to augment rigid kernels with the expressiveness to directly interact with the ERF of the computation during inference. Illustrated in Figure 1 (d), DKs learn free-form offsets on kernel coordinates to deform the original kernel space towards specific data modality, rather than recomposing data. This can directly adapt ERF while leaving receptive field untouched. The design of DKs that is agnostic to data coordinates naturally leads to two variants -the global DK and the local DK, which behave differently in practice as we later investigate. We justify our approach with theoretical results which show that ERF is strictly determined by data sampling locations and kernel values. Used as a generic drop-in replacement of rigid kernels, DKs achieve empirical results coherent with our developed theory. Concretely, we evaluate our operator with standard base models on image classification and object detection. DKs perform favorably against prior works that adapt during runtime. With both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we further show that DKs can work orthogonally and complementarily with previous techniques. In this paper, we introduced Deformable Kernels (DKs) to adapt effective receptive fields (ERFs) of convolutional networks for object deformation. We proposed to sample kernel values from the original kernel space. This in effect samples the ERF in linear networks and also roughly generalizes to non-linear cases. We instantiated two variants of DKs and validate our designs, showing connections to previous works. Consistent improvements over them and compatibility with them were found, as illustrated in visualizations. image patch kernel patch Figure 5 : Illustration of feed-forwarding through a 3\u00d73 local Deformable Kernel from a 4\u00d74 scope. For each input patch, local DK first generates a group of kernel offsets {\u2206k} from input feature patch using the light-weight generator G (a 3\u00d73 convolution of rigid kernel). Given the original kernel weights W and the offset group {\u2206k}, DK samples a new set of kernel W using a bilinear sampler B. Finally, DK convolves the input feature map and the sampled kernels to complete the whole computation.",

ComplexValued neural networks have been sucessfully applied to a variety of tasks specifically in signal processing where the input data has a natural interpretation in the complex domain.In most publications complex-valued neural networks are compared to real-valued architectures. We need to ensure that these architectures are comparable in their ability to approximate functions. A common metric for their capacity are the number of real-valued parameters. The number of parameters of complex-valued neural networks are rarely studied aspects. While complex numbers increase the computational complexity, their introduction also assumes a certain structure between weights and input. Hence, it is not sufficient to increase the number of parameters.Even more important than in real-valued networks is the choice of activation function for each layer. We test 5 functions: identity or no activation function, rectifier linear unit, hyperbolic tangent, magnitude, squared magnitude.

        "article": "As an emerging topic in face recognition, designing margin-based loss functions can increase the feature margin between different classes for enhanced discriminability. More recently, absorbing the idea of mining-based strategies is adopted to emphasize the misclassified samples and achieve promising results. However, during the entire training process, the prior methods either do not explicitly emphasize the sample based on its importance that renders the hard samples not fully exploited or explicitly emphasize the effects of semi-hard/hard samples even at the early training stage that may lead to convergence issues. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Curriculum Learning loss (CurricularFace) that embeds the idea of curriculum learning into the loss function to achieve a novel training strategy for deep face recognition, which mainly addresses easy samples in the early training stage and hard ones in the later stage. Specifically, our CurricularFace adaptively adjusts the relative importance of easy and hard samples during different training stages. In each stage, different samples are assigned with different importance according to their corresponding difficultness. Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our CurricularFace over the state-of-the-art competitors. Code will be available upon publication. The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on face recognition can be mainly credited to : enormous training data, network architectures, and loss functions. Recently, designing appropriate loss functions that enhance discriminative power is pivotal for training deep face CNNs. Current state-of-the-art face recognition methods mainly adopt softmax-based classification loss. Since the learned features with the original softmax is not discriminative enough for the open-set face recognition problem, several margin-based variants have been proposed to enhance features' discriminative power. For example, explicit margin, i.e., CosFace (Wang et al., 2018a) , Sphereface (Li et al., 2017) , ArcFace (Deng et al., 2019) , and implicit margin, i.e., Adacos (Zhang et al., 2019a) , supplement the original softmax function to enforce greater intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy, which are shown to result in more discriminate features. However, these margin-based loss functions do not explicitly emphasize each sample according to its importance. As demonstrated in Chen et al. (2019) , hard sample mining is also a critical step to further improve the final accuracy. Recently, Triplet loss (Schroff et al., 2015) and SV-Arc-Softmax (Wang et al., 2018b) integrate the motivations of both margin and mining into one framework for deep face recognition. Triplet loss adopts a semi-hard mining strategy to obtain semi-hard triplets and enlarge the margin between triplet samples. SV-Arc-Softmax (Wang et al., 2018b) clearly defines hard samples as misclassified samples and emphasizes them by increasing the weights of their negative cosine similarities with a preset constant. In a nutshell, mining-based loss functions explicitly emphasize the effects of semi-hard or hard samples. However, there are drawbacks in training strategies of both margin-and mining-based loss functions. For margin-based methods, mining strategy is ignored and thus the difficultness of each sample is not fully exploited, which may lead to convergence issues when using a large margin on small backbones, e.g., MobileFaceNet (Chen et al., 2018) . As shown in Fig. 1 , the modulation coefficient for the negative cosine similarities I(\u00b7) is fixed as a constant 1 in ArcFace for all samples during the entire training process. For mining-based methods, over-emphasizing hard samples in early training Figure 1: Different training strategies for modulating negative cosine similarities of hard samples (i.e., the mis-classified sample) in ArcFace, SV-Arc-Softmax and our CurricularFace. Left: The modulation coefficients I(t, cos \u03b8j) for negative cosine similarities of hard samples in different methods, where t is an adaptively estimated parameter and \u03b8j denotes the angle between the hard sample and the non-ground truth j-class center. Right: The corresponding hard samples' negative cosine similarities N (t, cos \u03b8j) = I(t, cos \u03b8j) cos \u03b8j + c after modulation, where c indicates a constant. On one hand, during early training stage (e.g., t is close to 0), hard sample's negative cosine similarities is usually reduced and thus leads to smaller hard sample loss than the original one. Therefore, easier samples are relatively emphasized; during later training stage (e.g., t is close to 1), the hard sample's negative cosine similarities are enhanced and thus leads to larger hard sample loss. On the other hand, in the same training stage, we modulate the hard samples' negative cosine similarities with cos \u03b8j. Specifically, the smaller the angle \u03b8j is, the larger the modulation coefficient should be. stage may hinder the model to converge. As SV-Arc-Softmax claimed, the manually defined constant t plays a key role in the model convergence property and a slight larger value (e.g., >1.4) may cause the model difficult to converge. Thus t needs to be carefully tuned. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive curriculum learning loss, termed CurricularFace, to achieve a novel training strategy for deep face recognition. Motivated by the nature of human learning that easy cases are learned first and then come the hard ones (Bengio et al., 2009) , our CurricularFace incorporates the idea of Curriculum Learning (CL) into face recognition in an adaptive manner, which differs from the traditional CL in two aspects. First, the curriculum construction is adaptive. In traditional CL, the samples are ordered by the corresponding difficultness, which are often defined by a prior and then fixed to establish the curriculum. In CurricularFace, the samples are randomly selected in each mini-batch, while the curriculum is established adaptively via mining the hard samples online, which shows the diversity in samples with different importance. Second, the importance of hard samples are adaptive. On one hand, the relative importance between easy and hard samples is dynamic and could be adjusted in different training stages. On the other hand, the importance of each hard sample in current mini-batch depends on its own difficultness. Specifically, the mis-classified samples in mini-batch are chosen as hard samples and weighted by adjusting the modulation coefficients I(t, cos\u03b8 j ) of cosine similarities between the sample and the non-ground truth class center vectors, i.e., negative cosine similarity N (t, cos\u03b8 j ). To achieve the goal of adaptive curricular learning in the entire training, we design a novel coefficient function I(\u00b7) that is determined by two factors: 1) the adaptively estimated parameter t that utilizes moving average of positive cosine similarities between samples and the corresponding ground-truth class center to unleash the burden of manually tuning; and 2) the angle \u03b8 j that defines the difficultness of hard samples to achieve adaptive assignment. To sum up, the contributions of this work are: \u2022 We propose an adaptive curriculum learning loss for face recognition, which automatically emphasizes easy samples first and hard samples later. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to introduce the idea of adaptive curriculum learning for face recognition. \u2022 We design a novel modulation coefficient function I(\u00b7) to achieve adaptive curriculum learning during training, which connects positive and negative cosine similarity simultaneously without the need of manually tuning any additional hyper-parameter. \u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on popular facial benchmarks, which demonstrate the superiority of our CurricularFace over the state-of-the-art competitors. Comparison with ArcFace and SV-Arc-Softmax We first discuss the difference between our CurricularFace and the two competitors, ArcFace and SV-Arc-Softmax, from the perspective of the decision boundary in Tab. 1. ArcFace introduces a margin function T (cos \u03b8 yi ) = cos(\u03b8 yi + m) from the perspective of positive cosine similarity. As shown in Fig. 4 , its decision condition changes from cos \u03b8 yi = cos \u03b8 j (i.e., blue line) to cos(\u03b8 yi + m) = cos \u03b8 j (i.e., red line) for each sample. SV-Arc-Softmax introduces additional margin from the perspective of negative cosine similarity for hard samples, and the decision boundary becomes cos(\u03b8 yi + m) = t cos \u03b8 j + t \u2212 1 (i.e., green line). Conversely, we adaptively adjust the weights of hard samples in different training stages. The decision condition becomes cos(\u03b8 yi +m) = (t+cos \u03b8 j ) cos \u03b8 j (i.e., purple line). During the training stage, the decision boundary for hard samples changes from one purple line (early stage) to another (later stage), which emphasizes easy samples first and hard samples later. Comparison with Focal loss Focal loss is a soft mining-based loss, which is formulated as: \u03b2 , where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are modulating factors that need to be tuned manually. The definition of hard samples in Focal loss is ambiguous, since it always focuses on relatively hard samples by reducing the weight of easier samples during the entire training process. In contrast, the definition of hard samples in our CurricularFace is more clear, i.e., mis-classified samples. Meanwhile, the weights of hard samples are adaptively determined in different training stages. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Curriculum Learning Loss that embeds the idea of adaptive curriculum learning into deep face recognition. Our key idea is to address easy samples in the early training stage and hard ones in the later stage. Our method is easy to implement and robust to converge. Extensive experiments on popular facial benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art competitors. Following the main idea of this work, future research can be expanded in various aspects, including designing a better function N (\u00b7) for negative cosine similarity that shares similar adaptive characteristic during training, and investigating the effects of noise samples that could be optimized as hard samples.",
