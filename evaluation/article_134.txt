Aspects:
- Language: low level of complex terms (1: chatgpt, 2: Claude, 3: cohere)
- Clarity and coherence: clear structure or explanation of the concepts in the paper (1:Claude, 2:chatgpt, 3:cohere)
- Detail: provide sufficient detail on the experimental results and significance of the findings (1:claude, 2: cohere, 3: Chatgpt)
- Confusing language: vague language like “They fixed a thing called loss scaling” (1:Claude, 2: chatgpt, 3:Cohere)

Important topics: Weight-sharing, novel perspective on weight-sharing NAS, empirical studies of weight-sharing in two settings (shallow feature map, CNN neural architecture search), EDARTS

Chatgpt: It is mentioning the concepts of weight-sharing, novel perspective on weight-sharing NAS and EDARTS outperforms previous methods. However it contains a hallucination: mentioning that weight-sharing helps to classify images (not stated in the text). The sentence 'Scientists are developing special algorithms to navigate the complex space of possible architectures' is not really important in context of paper. 

Cohere: It is mentioning the concepts weight-sharing. It has a clear description of why and what the research is about and that EDARTS outperforms previous methods. However the sentence 'offering solutions rooted in non-convex non-Euclidean optimization' is difficult to comprehend. Furthermore it not great to mention the target audience explicitly: 'offering students valuable insights into the evolving field of computer science, specifically AI and machine learning.' 

Claude: It is mentioning the concepts of weight-sharing, clear description of why and what the research is about, EDARTS outperforms previous methods, gives clear summary of the research of the paper (new algorithm and analysis if properties of this approach). The function of the sentence 'However, designing the architecture (structure) of these networks is a challenging problem.' is not clear

Evaluation
Cohere uses difficult language/concepts and mentions target audience explicitly. Claude gives clear description of why and what the research is about and provides all important concepts.
Chatgpt uses easier language than claude (eg explaining weight-sharing; claude:"way to extend the search space of possible architectures" vs chatgpt: "which helps optimize neural networks for tasks like image classification and natural language processing"). However, it mentions that weight-sharing helps to classify images which is not stated in the text.
