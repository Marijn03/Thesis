# Abstractive text summarization for high school students using Large Language Models on SCITLDR
## An evaluation of open-source models on computer science papers

In this repository you can find the code I have used to make summaries with the open-source model Llama 3. 
In the thesis, we use the abstract, introduction and conclusion from the SciTLDR training dataset (Cachola et al., 2020).
Their paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15011 

In order to run our code you should install the packages by the following code:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
